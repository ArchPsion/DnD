[Absorption] absorbs three levels of the spell, resulting in a 40% chance (2/5) that you will be affected normally. If affected, any saving throw the spell allows you still applies. Likewise, if you're struck by [Disintegrate] cast as a 6th-level spell with four levels of [Absorption] remaining, two levels of the spell remain, and you take only 33% (1/3) of the damage you would normally take from the spell.$$You can use captured spell energy to cast any spell you know or have prepared, but spells so cast don't disappear from your list of prepared spells or count against the number of spells you can normally cast per day (so you so must keep a running total of spell levels absorbed and used). The levels of spell energy you have stored must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell you want to cast, and you must have at hand (and expend) any material components required for the spell.

The wings grant you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor or carry a medium or heavy load), with good maneuverability.$$If you are not flying, you can use a standard action to make one wing attack or a full attack action to make two such attacks (as if they were natural weapons). Each wing deals 2d6 points of slashing damage (plus your Strength modifier), and threatens a critical hit on a 19–20. The wings are considered both magic and adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction or penetrating hardness. Wing strikes are not additional attacks; they replace any other attack or full attack action.$$As a swift action, you can choose to launch the adamantine feathers as a burst of razor-sharp blades. This attack takes the form of a 60-foot cone-shaped burst. All creatures within the cone take 10d6 points of damage (Reflex half; spell resistance applies). Since this is a spell effect, damage reduction does not affect the damage dealt by the cone. This action immediately ends the spell's duration.

It causes the target to instantly and fully succumb to the Dracorage, shifting the target's attitude toward nondragons to hostile and instilling in the dragon a bloodthirsty desire to murder and wreak havoc.

(Nevertheless, many casters of the spell will use subterfuge to trick the target dragon into allowing the spell to be cast freely upon it, thereby avoiding the dragon's high Will save bonus.) As with the Dracorage mythal itself, this spell ignores a dragon's spell resistance.$$[Aggravate Dracorage] functions only during the period of the Dracorage and has no effect on dragons at other times.

An ordinary worshiper placed under [Anathema] is not allowed to take advantage of any of the faith's services, such as healing, naming, marrying, or burial of the dead. Anyone who dies while under [Anathema] is barred from entry into his deity's plane just as though he had never declared allegiance to a god. His soul is condemned to eternally writhe in the Wall of the Faithless.$$On a more personal level, the [Anathema] spell marks the subject as accursed with regard to others of the faith. They are not allowed to speak to him, look at him, or even acknowledge his existence. The common members of the faith are only aware that the subject is under [Anathema] if so informed by the church hierarchy; however, clerics, paladins, druids and rangers of the faith can automatically detect an [Anathema] effect simply by looking at the subject.$$The effect is permanent until lifted, either by the original spellcaster, or by a cleric of the same faith, of a higher level than the caster, who casts an [Atonement] spell upon the subject. The subject of an [Anathema] can also remove its effect by changing his divine allegiance.$${{Focus:}} The subject's name must be inscribed in a book or scroll especially consecrated for this purpose and detailing the crimes (real or imagined) for which the subject is being condemned.

The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 2–2 in the {Dungeon Master's Guide}. The animal's space and reach change as indicated on Table 8–4: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change.$$The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws.$$If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it — the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.$$All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.$$The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting.

It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain). The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.$$During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. Unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored.

The {Monster Manual} has game statistics for skeletons.*{{Zombies.}} A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy, so a dead gelatinous cube, for example, cannot be animated as a zombie.

Treat a light weapon as an object two size categories smaller than its wielder, a one-handed weapon as one size category smaller than its wielder, and a two-handed weapon as an object of the same size as its wielder. However, the weapon deals its normal damage, not the damage noted for an animated object of its size, and it gains a bonus on attack rolls equal to the ability modifier used to set your spell save DCs. Diminutive or smaller objects are unaffected by the spell.$$An animated weapon attacks the nearest enemy to the best of its ability. You can use a move action to direct it to a different target, but if at the end of your turn you are more than 30 feet from the weapon, the spell ends. A weapon held or carried by another creature can't be affected by this spell.$$The weapon doesn't gain the benefit of any of your class features, feats, or other special abilities that would improve its combat ability. If the weapon has an enhancement bonus or other special properties, these apply as normal. For example, an animated +1 flaming longsword gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit.

If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you can request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway). The HD of the corpse to be animated (not counting class levels) cannot exceed your caster level.$$The possessed body attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the possessing spirit, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.$$While the body is inhabited by the spirit, it is treated as if were still alive but possessed. It uses the outsider's Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, mental abilities, and any class levels it might have. The body regains the Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and innate abilities of the creature the corpse represented when it was alive. For example, a sahuagin's body breathes water and a troll's body regenerates. The spirit can't choose to activate the host body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities, and the host body's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.$$The spirit remains within the body until the spell is dismissed, the duration ends, or the host body is slain, at which point it returns to its original body with no ill effects.$${{Sacrifice Component:}} 1d3 points of Strength drain.

As they fade from your hearing, you become more aware of both your surroundings and the possibility of intrusion.}$$The subject of the spell is surrounded with an invisible aura that anticipates and delays the teleportation of any creature into the spell's area. Any Teleportation spell or effect (including all spells with the Teleportation descriptor) can be anticipated, making the spell's recipient instantly aware of the exact location where the teleporting creature will arrive (subject to the restrictions below), the creature's size, and how many other creatures (and their sizes) are arriving with the teleporting creature. The spell also delays the arrival of the teleporting creature by 1 round (so that it arrives on its initiative count immediately before its next turn), generally giving the recipient of the spell and anyone else made aware of the information 1 round to act or ready actions. The teleporting creature does not perceive this delay.$$Since a teleporting creature doesn't necessarily arrive at the precise location it intends, the spell also functions against a creature that arrives in range even though its intended destination was elsewhere. For a creature that intends to teleport into range but inadvertently arrives outside the spell's area, the spell gives the recipient awareness that a creature has attempted to teleport into range and delays the creature as normal, but doesn't give any awarenes as to the actual location of its imminent arrival.$$The spell has no effect on creatures attempting to teleport away from the spell's area, although if their destination is within the area, the spell will affect their reentry as normal.$${{Focus:}} A tiny hourglass of platinum and crystal costing at least 500 gp, which must be carried or worn by the spell's recipient while the spell is in effect.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.$$An [Antimagic Field] suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field. Time spent within an [Antimagic Field] counts against the suppressed spell's duration. Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an [Antimagic Field]. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast [Antimagic Field] in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as [Create Water], are not affected by an [Antimagic Field] because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)$$A normal creature (a normally encountered griffon rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.$$[Dispel Magic] does not remove the field. Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as [Wall of Force], [Prismatic Sphere], and [Prismatic Wall], remain unaffected by [Antimagic Field] (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. (See the {Dungeon Master's Guide} for more about artifacts.)$$Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.$${{Arcane Material Component:}} A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.

When the spell is cast, you choose which version of the [Arcane Maul] to employ and in which hand to wield the melee version. An [Arcane Maul] cannot be first used in melee and then hurled, nor can the melee version be switched from hand to hand.*When used as a melee weapon, an [Arcane Maul] acts as a +4 warhammer (1d8+4/ ×3) for 1 round per level, and it can be wielded regardless of proficiency with the warhammer. Used empty-handed, an [Arcane Maul] appears as a shimmering, hammer-shaped force field. When it is used in a hand already holding a weapon, the shimmering force field wraps around both hand and weapon, but all effects of the material weapon (mundane or magic, including damage, bonuses, threat range, and special abilities) are lost for the duration of the spell. An [Arcane Maul] can be used with a weapon in your off hand, but the regular penalties for two-weapon fighting apply.*If hurled, an [Arcane Maul] shoots out from your fist as a line 50 feet long, then fills a 20-foot-radius burst at the end of its range.

A successful Fortitude save halves damage and negates the stun effect.^A hurled [Arcane Maul] damages objects in its area. It destroys nonmagical crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain, smashing those substances into dozens of pieces. Objects that weigh more than your caster level in pounds take damage as normal. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, an [Arcane Maul] can continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.$${{Material Component:}} A small clay hammer, crushed in the fist as the spell is cast.

The effect is similar to that of a [Detect Magic] spell, but [Arcane Sight] does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.$$You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the [Detect Magic] spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make [Spellcraft] skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect.)$$If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use. In some cases, [Arcane Sight] may give a deceptively low reading — for example, when you use it on a spellcaster who has used up most of his or her daily spell allotment. [Arcane Sight] can be made permanent with a [Permanency] spell.

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.$$You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.$$While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord (see the {Dungeon Master's Guide} for more information). When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.$$You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as [Dispel Magic] cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).$${{Material Component:}} A jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp, plus a silver bar worth 5 gp for each person to be affected.

The creature seeking [Atonement] must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, [Atonement] operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject's burden.

If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.*{{Redemption or Temptation.}} You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.$$Though the spell description refers to evil acts, [Atonement] can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.$${{Note:}} Normally, changing alignment is up to the player (for PCs) or the DM (for NPCs).

The DM may determine that a question is so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the [Augury] succeeds, you get one of four results:*Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).*Woe (for bad results).*Weal and woe (for both).*Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).$$If the spell fails, you get the "nothing" result. A cleric who gets the "nothing" result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful [Augury].$$The [Augury] can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result.

In addition to the [Resist Energy] (fire) effect, the spell can be used to snuff out fires.$$Any nonmagical flame that the aura contacts is immediately extinguished if the flame's maximum damage is 10 or fewer points per round. This means that torches, small fires, and hurled alchemist's fire are snuffed out and cause no damage if used against you or if you touch them.$$You can use a standard action to touch an existing magical fire (such as a [Flaming Sphere] or a [Wall of Fire]) and attempt to dispel it as if using a [Dispel Magic] spell against it (use the caster level of [Aura against Flame] for the caster level check). If you succeed, you tak no damage from the touch and the magical fire and aura both vanish. If you fail, you take damage from the magical fire source normally (reduced by your [Aura against Flame]), and both spells remain.$$With a readied action, you can use the aura as a [Dispel Magic] effect to counterspell a magical fire attack against you.

If the attack is successful, the subject loses half its hit points (rounded down) and is stunned for 1 round. On a successful Fortitude saving throw, the subject is not stunned. Oozes and plants are not affected by this spell.$$The [Avascular Mass] instantaneously erupts from the subject and must be anchored to at least two opposed points — such as floor and ceiling or opposite walls — or else the mass collapses and has no effect. Creatures caught within a 20-foot-radius [Avascular Mass] become entangled. The original target of the spell is automatically entangled. Because the [Avascular Mass] is magically animate and gradually tightens on those it holds, an entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a DC 25 [Concentration] check or lose the spell.$$Anyone within 20 feet of the primary target when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the [Avascular Mass] and is free to act, though moving might be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 [Escape Artist] check. Once loose (either from making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or [Escape Artist] check), a creature can progress through the writhing blood vessels very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or [Escape Artist] check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.$$If you have at least 5 feet of [Avascular Mass] between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of [Avascular Mass] between you, it provides total cover.$$The [Avascular Mass] of entangling tissue persists for 1 round per caster level. When the duration elapses, the blood vessel mass becomes so much limp, decaying tissue.

In a moment you're safe, and you gain a brief respite — time enough to cast more permanent protective spells.}$$You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane. These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself (DMG 150).$$[Avoid Planar Effects] provides protection from the 3d10 points of fire damage that characters normally take when on a plane with the fire-dominant trait. [Avoid Planar Effects] allows a character to breathe water on a water-dominant plane and ignore the threat of suffocation on an earth-dominant plane. A character protected by [Avoid Planar Effects] can't be blinded by the energy of a major positive-dominant plane and automatically stops gaining temporary hit points when they equal the character's full normal hit point total. Negative-dominant planes don't deal damage or bestow negative levels to characters protected by [Avoid Planar Effects].$$In addition, some effects specific to a plane are negated by [Avoid Planar Effects]. In the D&D cosmology, [Avoid Planar Effects] negates the deafening effect of Pandemonium and the cold damage on the Cania layer of the Nine Hells. The DM can add additional protections for a cosmology he creates. If the campaign has an Elemental Plane of Cold, for example, [Avoid Planar Effects] protects against the base cold damage dealt to everyone on the plane.$$The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren't negated by [Avoid Planar Effects], nor is the special entrapping trait of certain planes (such as Elysium and Hades).$$The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane. This spell allows you to survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth, for instance, but it won't protect you if you walk into a pool of magma on that same plane.

Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the creature moves forward. Engulfed opponents are considered grappled and are trapped within the sand creature's body. The sand creature deals 1d6+3 points of damage to trapped opponents each round after the one in which it engulfed them. Opponents that need to breathe risk suffocation (see page 304 of the {Dungeon Master's Guide}). The save DC is Strength-based.$$Sand creatures are amorphous and can do anything sand would be expected to do — hide perfectly atop other sand, form into dunes and drifts, and pour through small openings (although passing through an opening two size categories smaller than the creature takes a full-round action).$${{XP Cost:}} 500.

Counterspell attempts are otherwise handled normally, and you can counter the spell even if you do not have line of sight to the spellcaster. If you counter a spell in this manner, the [Battlemagic Perception] spell ends immediately.

Upon casting the spell, you must name or describe a specific creature. If that creature is subsequently reduced to –10 or fewer hit points by a blow from the target weapon before the spell's duration expires, its soul is whisked immediately to the Hall of the Vanquished in Stygia, where it remains forever, or until rescued. A weapon can gain the effect of only one [Bind to Hell] spell at a time.$$The soul manifests as a frozen version of its mortal self. With the utterance of a trigger word chosen by you upon casting, it can be temporarily imbued with motion and the use of its faculties. A subsequent utterance of the trigger word freezes the soul again.$$While the soul is in the Hall of the Vanquished, life-restoring spells and effects, such as [Raise Dead], [Reincarnate], and [Resurrection], cannot be used to revive the creature. If the soul form of a nonoutsider is removed from the hall, it transmigrates immediately to its proper afterlife, after which life-restoring effects again become possible.$${{Special:}} Only divine casters who worship Levistus can cast this spell.

The target gets an initial saving throw only if its HD equal at least one-half your caster level.$$You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts [Suggestion], your caster level for this casting of [Binding] increases by 1. For each assistant who casts [Dominate Animal], [Dominate Person], or [Dominate Monster], your caster level for this casting of [Binding] increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a [Binding] spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the [Binding] spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the [Binding] lasts. All [Binding] spells are dismissible.$$Regardless of the version of [Binding] you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, or hit points don't qualify. For example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.$$If you are casting any of the first three versions of [Binding] (those with limited durations), you may cast additional [Binding] spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the [Binding] spells it has received are broken.$$The [Binding] spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.*{{Chaining.}} The subject is confined by restraints that generate an [Antipathy] spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of [Binding] is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.*{{Slumber.}} This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of [Binding] is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.*{{Bound Slumber.}} This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.*{{Hedged Prison.}} The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.*{{Metamorphosis.}} The subject assumes [Gaseous Form], except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The [Binding] is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.*{{Minimus Containment.}} The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The [Binding] is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.$$You can't dispel a [Binding] spell with [Dispel Magic] or a similar effect, though an [Antimagic Field] or [Mordenkainen's Disjunction] affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to [Dismissal], [Banishment], or a similar effect.$${{Material Component:}} The components for a [Binding] spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of [Binding] used. These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals (silver for lycanthropes, cold iron for demons, and so forth), soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like.$$In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of [Binding] (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.

The chain creates an oscillating ring surrounding the target at a distance of 5 feet (so all squares adjacent to the target creature are within the chain). If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, the chain fails to encircle it and dissipates harmlessly. Otherwise, the chain surrounds the target, with the following effects.$$The target creature cannot leave the area defined by the chain. Other creatures can enter or leave the area (although they must succeed on a DC 15 [Escape Artist] check or a DC 15 [Tumble] check to slip past the chain). If the target was in midair (flying, levitating, and so on) when the chain took effect, the chain suspends the target in midair safely as if it had a solid floor on which to stand.$$The chain prevents the target from changing form, including lycanthropic form changes, vampiric transformations, or [Polymorph] or similar effects. The chain acts as a [Dimensional Anchor] upon the target. The chain deals 2d6 points of force damage per round to the target.$$No magic functions within the chain, as if the chain defined the area of an [Antimagic Field]. This means that the target cannot use any magic, and no magic from outside the chain affects the creature. The chain cannot be dispelled, but it is automatically destroyed by [Disintegrate], [Mordenkainen's Disjunction], or a rod of cancellation.$${{Material Component:}} A tiny silver chain.

Its attack bonus is equal to your base attack bonus + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively).$$Anything hit by the blade is [1Disintegrated] if it fails a Fortitude save, taking 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 40d6), or 5d6 points of damage if the saving throw is successful. The blade can pass through any magical barrier equal to or less than its spell level, but cannot penetrate dead magic areas or an [Antimagic Field]. It can harm ethereal and incorporeal creatures as if it were a force effect.$$The blade always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. If the blade exceeds its range or goes out of your line of sight, the spell ends. You can direct the blade to attack another target as a standard action.$$A [Gate] spell can be used to counterspell a [Black Blade of Disaster]. A [Dimensional Anchor] spell cast at the blade dispels it automatically. The blade cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but [Dispel Magic], a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation can affect it. Its touch attack AC is 13.

You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.$$Blinking has several effects, as follows.$$Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the [Blind-Fight] feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment). If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.$$Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.$$While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC. You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.$$While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)$$Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost.$$An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects (such as [Magic Missile] and [Wall of Force]) and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.

The subject gestures as if making a melee attack, but the result of the attack affects a target within range.

The subject uses its normal melee attack bonuses and deals damage normally if it hits, though the target of the attacks can benefit from cover or concealment.

Cold sweeps over your body as you glance down at your now-metallic flesh.}$$When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a warforged titan (Eberron Campaign Setting 302). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to construct, and your size changes to Huge. You have the space and reach of a warforged titan (15 feet/15 feet). Your mindset changes so that you relish combat and cannot cast spells, even from magic items. You gain the Strength and Dexterity of an average warforged titan (Strength 28, Dexterity 8), but you retain your own mental ability scores. You have no Constitution score while affected by this spell. Your base land speed becomes 50 feet. You gain [Darkvision] out to 60 feet. You also gain [Low-Light Vision].$$Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base saving throw bonuses all remain the same. You lose any extraordinary special abilities of your own form, as well as spell-like and supernatural abilities. You keep all extraordinary special attacks derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's [Rage] or a rogue's sneak attack), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels. You cannot speak or cast spells while in warforged titan form. Your natural armor bonus becomes +18, regardless of any natural armor bonus from your normal form, and you gain damage reduction 10/adamantine.$$As a construct, you have the following qualities: immunity to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, energy drain, and to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless). You also gain the warforged titan's two attack forms (axe and maul), along with the [Trample] special ability (damage 1d8+13; Reflex DC 25 half). The warforged titan's axe deals 2d8 points of slashing damage and has a ×3 critical modifier; its maul (essentially a huge warhammer) deals 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage and also has a ×3 critical modifier. Your equipment melds into your new form and becomes nonfunctional.$${{Material Component:}} A miniature bronze hammer.

[Break Enchantment] can reverse even an instantaneous effect, such as [Flesh to Stone]. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.$$If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by [Dispel Magic], [Break Enchantment] works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. For instance, [Bestow Curse] cannot be dispelled by [Dispel Magic], but [Break Enchantment] can dispel it.$$If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, [Break Enchantment] does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects. For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user. [Break Enchantment] allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item — even if it's the recent recipient of the [Break Enchantment] spell.

The maximum number of HD of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level. A dire animal or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; other animals are not. (A druid could calm a normal bear or wolf with little trouble, but it's more difficult to affect a trained guard dog.)$$The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat (such as fire, a hungry predator, or an imminent attack) breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.

It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the confused condition from all targets. While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect. When the [Calm Emotions] spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Every time a creature moves into an area covered by [Caltrops] or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area, it might step on one. The caltrops make one attack roll (+0 melee) against the creature. For this attack, the target's shield and deflection bonuses do not count, nor does its armor bonus for armor worn. A target wearing shoes or other footwear gains a +2 armor bonus to AC (which does count). If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one.$$A successful attack by a caltrop deals 1 point of damage. If the target is Small, Medium, or Large, its land speed is reduced by one-half because of the injury. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 [Heal] check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.$$The DM judges the effectiveness of caltrops against unusual opponents or opponents outside the size range given above. A giant centipede, for example, can scramble among the caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant wearing thick, massive boots might be immune to their attacks.$$For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you can affect an additional 5-foot-by-5-foot square, and the caltrops' attack bonus increases by 1. Thus, you affect two squares at 3rd level (+1 melee), three at 5th level (+2 melee), four at 7th level (+3 melee), and a maximum of five at 9th level or higher (+4 melee maximum).$$Multiple [Caltrops] spells (or mundane caltrops) occupying the same space have no additional effect.

That creature must resist a bull rush attack from the [Capricious Zephyr], which has a +6 bonus on the check. If the spell wins the bull rush, it pushes the creature as far as it can in a random direction (roll 1d8; 1 indicates a push into the square closest to you, and 2 through 8 indicate the other squares, moving clockwise around the creature). Any creature pushed by the sphere must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone.$$A [Capricious Zephyr] moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you). Otherwise, it merely stays at rest and attempts to bowl over anyone in its square. The spell ends if the distance between the sphere and you ever exceeds the spell's range.

A creature can avert its eyes, which grants a 50% chance to avoid the gaze but in turn grants you concealment relative to it. A creature can close its eyes or turn away entirely; doing so prevents the gaze from affecting it but grants you total concealment from that creature.$$In addition, you can actively attempt to use the gaze as a standard action each round. To do so, you choose a target within range, and that target must attempt a saving throw. A target that is averting or shutting its eyes gains the above benefits.

The range increment for the hurled object is 30 feet, regardless of its normal range increment (if any).$$If you use [Catapult] to fling an object not meant to be used as a thrown weapon, you take the normal –4 nonproficiency penalty on the attack roll. An item that isn't a weapon deals 1d6 points of base damage if it weighs at least 1 pound.$$The item [Catapult] is to affect must be in your hands when you cast the spell. If you cast the spell with nothing in your hands to fling, the magic automatically fails. You cannot propel living creatures with [Catapult], regardless of their size.

After the missiles strike, they ricochet to a number of targets up to the number of missiles created by the spell. Each secondary target takes 1d4+1 points of damage, as if struck by a single [Magic Missile]. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no secondary target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example). Missiles without a secondary target do not ricochet off the primary target.$$Spells, magic items, and abilities that protect against [Magic Missile] (such as the [Shield] spell or a brooch of shielding) also protect against this spell. If the primary target has that sort of protection, the spell has no effect against it but still springs to all secondary targets. (A brooch of shielding loses a number of charges equal to the number of missiles hitting the creature — up to ten missiles.) If spell resistance causes the spell to fail to harm the primary target, the spell fails and missiles do not ricochet to additional targets.$$The missiles strike unerringly, even if the targets are in melee or have anything less then total cover or concealment. You cannot single out specific parts of a creature to strike. This spell cannot target or damage inanimate objects.

When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant (see the {Monster Manual}). The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.$${{Focus:}} The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew, then cured, shaped, carved, and polished (a process requiring twenty-eight days).

If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.$$The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but a charmed fighter, for example, might believe you if you assured him that the only chance to save your life is for him to hold back an onrushing red dragon for "just a few seconds." Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

This spell can affect only nonmagical games, such as those using cards or dice. It cannot affect a game involving magic, nor a magic item involved in a game of chance (such as a deck of many things). Whenever a dice roll is made to determine the outcome of the game, a character under the effect of this spell can demand a reroll and take the better of the two rolls.$$Anyone observing the game of chance is allowed a Will saving throw to realize something fishy is going on, and might suspect that the outcome of the game has been magically altered.$$For example, Darkon is playing a game that he has a 1 in 4 chance of winning. The DM secretly rolls 1d4 and tells the player that Darkon lost. Because Darkon is under the effect of a [Cheat] spell, the player can have the DM reroll. The spell alters probability, so there is no subterfuge that another character could notice (except for the casting of the spell itself).$${{Focus:}} A pair of dice made from human bones.

In addition, you can cause it to cast a red glow as bright as a torch. Any creature within the radius of its clear illumination (20 feet) gets a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.$$If the weapon leaves your grasp, the spell effect is suppressed until you or another worshiper of your deity picks it up.

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. (Magic item's saving throws are covered in the {Dungeon Master's Guide}.) An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.$$A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.$$On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.#{{Round}};{{Metal Temperature}};{{Damage}}:1;Cold;None:2;Icy;1d4 points:3–5;Freezing;2d4 points:6;Icy;1d4 points:7;Cold;None#Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a [Chill Metal] spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a [Wall of Fire] in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage. Underwater, [Chill Metal] deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.$$[Chill Metal] counters and dispels [Heat Metal].

Unlike a [Web] spell, the strands of a [Choking Cobwebs] spell need not be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points, though they can be. Unsupported cobwebs flutter in the air as through held up by a rising current.$$The cobwebs block sight beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment. Creatures farther away have total concealment.$$Entering a square of cobwebs costs 2 squares of movement. A living creature that enters [Choking Cobwebs] falls into a fit of horrific coughing, making it sickened for as long as it remains in the area and for 1 round after it leaves. A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect, but the save must be repeated each round the creature enters or remains within the area.$$If two or more [Choking Cobwebs] spells overlap the same area, the overlapping area of the two spells becomes a nearly impenetrable barrier of stands. In addition to the effects described above, any creature within the overlapping area has cover against adjacent creatures, and total cover against creatures more than 5 feet away. Entering a square of overlapping cobwebs costs 4 squares of movement, and a living creature within this area is nauseated rather than sickened (Fortitude negates) and also takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage in each round that it is nauseated.

If you grapple an opponent, you deal claw damage with each successful grapple check, and the grappled target is under the effect of a [Slow] spell for as long as you maintain the grapple. An opponent that makes a successful Fortitude save is not slowed, and it cannot be slowed by this casting of [Claws of Darkness].$$You can extend the claws up to 6 feet, which gives you a natural reach of 10 feet, or retract them as a free action.$$When the spell is in effect, you cannot cast spells with components other than verbal ones, nor can you carry items with your hands.

If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the [Clone], creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to return; see {Bringing Back the Dead}, page 171). The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.$$To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting (for example, by the [Gentle Repose] spell). Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.$$When the [Clone] is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The [Clone] is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the [Clone] as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including the loss of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the original was a 1st-level character). If this Constitution adjustment would give the [Clone] a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the [Clone] would otherwise be, the [Clone] is one level below the level at which the original died.$$The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not preserved.$${{Material Component:}} The piece of flesh and various laboratory supplies (cost 1,000 gp).${{Focus:}} Special laboratory equipment (cost 500 gp).

While [Contingent Energy Resistance] is in effect, if you are dealt damage associated with one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the spell automatically grants you resistance 10 against that type of energy for up to 10 minutes per caster level, or until the remainder of the spell's duration, just as if you were under the effect of a [Resist Energy] spell of the appropriate type.$$Once the energy type protected against by a particular casting of this spell is determined, it can't be changed.

For either version, the caster can reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.*{{Lower Sand:}} This effect causes sand to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level, to a minimum depth of 1 inch. The dust and sand is lowered within a square-shaped depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level. In extremely large and deep sand piles, such as a sand dune, the spell creates a pit that sweeps creatures downward (without dealing damage), putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on earth elementals, dust paraelementals, and other earth- or dust-based creatures, this spell acts as a [Slow] spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures.*{{Raise Sand:}} This effect causes dust and sand to rise in height, just as the lower sand version causes it to lower. Creatures and objects on top of the dust or sand are raised along with the top level of sand.

A double of you appears nearby.}$$You create a fetch, a perfect replica of your form at the time you cast this spell. Little more than an animated reproduction, a fetch is mindless but capable of performing simple tasks or imitating you. The creation is the same size as you and occupies space just as a living creature does. You have a mental connection with your fetch and can give it new orders as a standard action.$$The fetch duplicates your form in every way but texture. You must make a [Disguise] check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is; this result is opposed by observers' [Spot] checks as normal. Anyone touching the fetch finds it rubbery and soft, and in so doing immediately realizes its magical nature. The fetch's body includes useless versions of all the equipment you possess: A weapon wielded by the fetch is too flimsy to deal damage, and tools it carries are fragile and imprecise. Items created with a fetch are part of its form and dissipate if separated from it.$$At your order, the fetch can retrieve things for you, open unstuck doors, hold chairs, and the like, as well as perform menial tasks such as cleaning and mending. The fetch can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a skill that can't be used untrained. It can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity tirelessly if ordered to do so as long as you remain within the spell's range. You can have the fetch imitate you, such as by sitting at a desk and pretending to write, lying in bed and breathing deeply, or skulking with a weapon drawn. It can even imitate tasks it can't actually perform, though it automatically fails any attempt at such performance — for instance, even though a fetch can pretend to decipher an ancient text, it can't actually do it.$$The fetch weighs roughly the same as you do, so it can trigger any traps you would if you were to pass through the same space, setting off tripwires, pressure plates, some magical forms of detection, and similar devices. Its land speed is normal for a creature of your kind (for example, 30 feet for a human or 20 feet for a halfling). Even if you normally have other modes of movement available (such as a fly or swim speed), the fetch can't use those.$$The fetch automatically fails any saving throw required of it. If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), it ceases to exist.$$A Medium-sized fetch has an effective Strength score of 6, so it can lift up to 60 pounds or drag 300 pounds. A Large or Small creature's fetch has the same Strength but different carrying capacity and drag capacity (see PH 162). Its Dexterity is 10, so it has an AC of 10 (plus size modifier). It gains no AC benefit from any equipment or effect on you when the spell is cast (such as armor you wear, since the armor created for it is part of its form), though it can then wear real armor or other items to increase its AC. It has no Constitution score and 10 hit points; if reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. It can't be healed, nor can it benefit from temporary hit points. The fetch has no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. You can command it to make noise, but it can't communicate in any way, nor can it understand instructions other than the simple orders you give it telepathically.$$The fetch cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. Even if armed, it doesn't threaten an area around it and thus can't flank an enemy, nor can it use the Aid Another action to improve your AC or attack rolls.$$The fetch has the same alignment aura as you do. [Detect Thoughts] does not register its existence (since it has no Intelligence), but [Detect Magic] reveals it as a magical effect.$${{Material Component:}} One of your own hairs.

At the beginning of your next turn, when you finish casting the spell, it has a second effect. When you start casting this spell, your target takes a –2 penalty on attacks, checks, saves, and AC. He also takes a 20-foot penalty to speed. This effect does not allow a saving throw, but spell resistance applies. If you fail to overcome the target's spell resistance, you immediately stop casting the spell, and the secondary effect does not take place.$$When you complete the casting of this spell, your target must make a Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed. Even if the target makes this saving throw, this spell's initial effect continues to affect him for the spell's duration. This spell's duration begins after you have completed casting it.

The incubation period is instantaneous, and the initial save for the spell is calculated normally; all subsequent daily saves to avoid damage are DC 20. Mummy rot deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage immediately, and a similar amount per day thereafter; a victim reduced to 0 Constitution shrivels away into sand and dust.$$Furthermore, any character attempting to cast any healing spell on a creature afflicted with mummy rot must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell has no effect.$$Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot can't be overcome through natural methods or successful saves. To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be broken with [Break Enchantment], [Remove Curse], or a similar effect (requiring a DC 20 caster level check). If this is done, a caster level check is no longer necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and mummy rot can be magically cured like any disease.

For example, if you spend a 4th-level spell slot to cast [Curse of the Elemental Lords] and a 6th-level spell slot to augment it, the resulting curse adds 1d6+6 points of damage to the damage taken by targets of your spells of the chosen energy type. [Curse of the Elemental Lords] can't be dispelled, but it can be removed by any effect that would remove a curse.$${{Special:}} If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), the extra damage from this spell also applies to your breath weapon (assuming that it deals the appropriate type of damage).

Reaching out, you pull them tight about your subject, creating an invisible cocoon of mystical forces.}$$This spell surrounds the subject with a mystical field that dampens the effects of magic. While it is in effect, the enhancement bonus of any magic weapon used against the subject is lowered by 1. For instance, a +4 longsword would have only a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls when wielded against the subject. However, even if a weapon's enhancement bonus is reduced below +1, its masterwork bonus still applies. Similarly, every spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that affects the subject — whether it is specifically targeted on the subject or merely includes the subject in its area — takes a –1 penalty to caster level and save DC.$$The subject of the spell can choose, as a move action, to lower this field to receive the full effects of beneficial spells, but doing so might leave him vulnerable until his next turn, since raising the effect again also requires a move action. Ongoing magical effects already in place on the subject when [Dampen Magic] is cast (such as [Bull's Strength] or the enhancement bonuses of its own equipment) are unaffected, but any item the subject picks up and any spell he receives after [Dampen Magic] is in effect are affected as normal.$$For every six caster levels above 7th that you possess, the spell reduces incoming effects by one additional point. Thus, if your caster level is 13th–18th, the reduction to the enhancement bonus of weapons and the caster levels and save DCs of spells used against the subject is 2, and if your caster level is 19th or higher, the reduction is 3.$$At any time when [Dampen Magic] has 5 or more rounds of duration left, the subject can render itself utterly immune to most magic for a brief period. The effect produced is an [Antimagic Field], which surrounds the subject to a radius of 5 feet. Divide the remaining rounds of duration by 5 and round down; the result is the number of rounds the antimagic effect lasts. Once that time expires, the spell ends, and once the [Antimagic Field] has been invoked, the original spell effect cannot be reinstated.

In the next round, the subject remains within the emanation and takes another 3 points of damage in battle. The festering begins again, dealing 3 points of festering damage in the following round.

The target of your spell glows momentarily with a white nimbus of crackling energy that fades to a sickly gray before disappearing completely.}$$This powerful phantasm fools the subject into believing itself more competent and safe than it really is. The spell makes any action the subject considers attempting seem easily accomplished, requiring only a token effort. Deadly wounds seem like mere scratches, stalwart foes appear weak and intimidated, and the subject's own attacks seem stronger and more effective. As a result of its skewed perceptions, the subject takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks, as well as to Wisdom. This penalty cannot reduce the subject's Wisdom below 1. Finally, the subject becomes so completely enamored with its own (false) abilities that it cannot fight defensively or take the total defense action.

You can use [Dispel Magic] to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by [Dispel Magic]. [Dispel Magic] can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.$${{Note:}} The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the [Dispel Magic] can take effect. Thus, you can't use [Dispel Magic] to repair fire damage caused by a [Fireball] or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.$$You choose to use [Dispel Magic] in one of three ways: a Targeted Dispel, an Area Dispel, or a Counterspell:*{{Targeted Dispel.}} One object, creature, or spell is the target of the [Dispel Magic] spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.^For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets [Dispel Magic] on a drow who is under the effects of [Haste], [Mage Armor], and [Bull's Strength]. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the [Haste], [Mage Armor], and [Bull's Strength] effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.^If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.^If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.^You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.*{{Area Dispel.}} When [Dispel Magic] is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.^For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the [Dispel Magic] spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.^For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an Area Dispel.^For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the [Dispel Magic] spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.^For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the [Dispel Magic] spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.^If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.^You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.*{{Counterspell.}} When [Dispel Magic] is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a Counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, [Dispel Magic] may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

However, [Dispel Water] cannot counter an instantaneous spell or effect. You choose to use [Dispel Water] in one of three ways: to dry up a body of water, to counter a water-based spell or effect, or to dismiss an extraplanar creature of the water subtype.*{{Dry Up Water:}} This effect instantly destroys 200 cubic feet of water per level. Remaining water rushes in to fill the void. Cast in a large body of water, such as an ocean, the destruction of 1,000 or more cubic feet of water produces a strong current that pulls boats and creatures down. Creatures caught in the current must make a DC 20 [Swim] check to avoid going under. A creature that fails the [Swim] check is pulled down to a depth of 10 feet per caster level and must hold its breath or begin to drown (see page 304 of the {Dungeon Master's Guide}). The current might capsize vessels: The chance is 95% for a craft shorter than 20 feet long, 50% for one from 20 to 60 feet long, and 20% for one over 60 feet long.*{{Counterspell:}} Used in this way, [Dispel Water] targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (see page 170 of the {Player's Handbook}). It only counters spells and spell-like abilities that have the water descriptor, or appear on the Water domain spell list, or clearly involve water (such as [Create Food and Water], [Sleet Storm], and [Wall of Ice]). To successfully counter the other spell, you must make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +20) against a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level.*{{Dismiss Water Creature:}} Cast in this way, [Dispel Water] targets a single extraplanar creature of the water subtype within range. The creature can negate the effect with a successful Will save (and its spell resistance, if any, applies). If it fails to save or resist the spell, the creature is forced back to its home plane.

When you successfully cast this spell, your breath weapon acts as a targeted [Dispel Magic].$$For each creature or object that fails its saving throw against your breath weapon and that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the highest level spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the spell's caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell or until you fail all your checks. A creature's magic items are not affected, and creatures and objects that rolled successful saving throws against your breath weapon are likewise not affected.$$If a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), is in the area and fails its saving throw against your breath weapon, you can also make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the creature (returning it whence it came).$$For each ongoing area or effect spell centered within the area of your breath weapon, you make a dispel check to dispel the spell.

Therefore the [Divination] response might be: "Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth." In all cases, the DM controls what information you receive.

Paladins, blackguards, and other classes capable of rebuking and turning also suffer a temporary loss of this ability. This affects the subject's ability to channel energy through the use of a turn or rebuke attempt, and so also interferes with the use of many divine feats.

Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger than the dominated animal) are simply ignored.$$[Dominate Animal] establishes a mental link between you and the subject creature. The animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains in range. You need not see the creature to control it. You do not receive direct sensory input from the creature, but you know what it is experiencing. Because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it may be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own comprehension, such as manipulating objects with its paws and mouth. You need not concentrate exclusively on controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn't do. Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.$$Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a [Sense Motive] check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the [Sense Motive] skill description, page 81).$$Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.$$By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth).$$Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.$$If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.$$[Protection from Evil] or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it.

At the beginning of the spell, you must name the subject or identify him by some title that leaves no doubt as to his identity. You then enter a trance and appear in the subject's dream. So long as you remain in his dream, you see the world through the eyes of his physical form, and you control his body as per the spell [Dominate Monster]. The subject is aware of you in his dream, and can identify you if he knows you personally. Once the spell ends, or if the subject shakes off the effect due to a new save granted by instructions contrary to his moral code (this new save gains a +2 bonus; see [Dominate Person]), he remembers what he has done while under the effects of [Dreaming Puppet]. These memories are dreamlike and not entirely clear, but the subject recalls the gist of all that happened.$$If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. You can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep (assuming the spell's duration lasts that long), then enter the recipient's dream and dominate him as normal. If you are disturbed and awaken during the trance, the spell ends.$$Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves), don't dream, or are otherwise immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities are immune to this spell.$$You are unaware of your own surroundings or of the activities around you while in the trance.

If the target exceeds the required Will save by 10 or more, or rolls a natural 20, not only are you barred from controlling him but your soul becomes lost in the dreamscape, unable to easily return to your own body. In order to return to your body, you must either find your way through the realm of dreams (and possibly other planes as well), cast a planar traveling spell, or be rescued.

The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a [Concentration] check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The [Earthquake] affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an [Earthquake] spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.*{{Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel.}} The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An [Earthquake] cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.*{{Cliffs.}} [Earthquake] causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. An [Earthquake] cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).*{{Open Ground.}} Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.*{{Structure.}} Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. (See the {Dungeon Master's Guide} for information on hit points for walls and the like.) Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).*{{River, Lake, or Marsh.}} Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.*{{Pinned beneath Rubble.}} Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

The subject gains immunity to any energy types used in that attack (but only for that attack), and also heals a number of points of damage equal to 1/2 the damage the effect would normally have caused. For instance, if a red dragon breathes fire on the subject for 87 points of damage, he could decide as an immediate action to absorb the effect, thus healing 43 points of damage instead of taking any damage.

Slowly it rises from your hand, emitting a soft beam that illuminates the chosen area. Then it disappears, and you place the spell within the magic trap.}$$You create a lingering zone of transformative magic that absorbs magic energy from magic items or spellcasting and uses it to power another spell tied to that location. For example, you could have an [Energy Transformation Field] tied to a [Summon Monster V] spell that would summon a monster when the field had absorbed enough magic.$$The field absorbs the magic of spells cast, spell-like or supernatural abilities that are activated, and magic items used within its dimensions. Each source of magic provides spell levels of energy to the field equal to the spell level of the effect used. Supernatural abilities that emulate spells provide energy equal to the spell level of the effect. Supernatural abilities that do not emulate spells provide energy equal to the HD of the creature using the ability. For example, a cast [Fireball] spell or a charge from a wand of [Fireball] would add three spell levels to the field's store, a potion of [Cure Light Wounds] would add one, and a [Wish] from a ring of three wishes would add nine. Items that don't have a clearly defined spell level (such as the effects of most rods) use the pre-requisite caster level needed to create that item (so an immovable rod would provide two spell levels every time it was activated because of its [Levitate] prerequisite). Effects that are absorbed give no indication of where the magic went; they simply vanish.$$The field absorbs only magic that is actually used within its area. Ongoing magical effects that enter the area, including spells cast from outside the area into the field or continually functioning items such as a +1 mace, are often visibly reduced, but do not have their actual effects hindered. For example, a [Continual Flame] would dim slightly, but its overall magic would not be affected.$$An [Energy Transformation Field] has a single spell linked to it. When the field has absorbed spell levels equal to the spell level of its linked spell, it automatically casts that spell at a point within the field designated by you at the time of the casting of the field. This expends those absorbed spell levels (although unused levels remain until they are used or expire). The cast spell functions as if cast by you in terms of duration and all level-based spell effects. Absorbed spell levels fade at a rate of one per day if not used. The field automatically triggers its linked spell if it has enough stored spell levels and the duration of its previous casting has expired. If a linked spell requires concentration to maintain, the field expends one spell level for every hour of concentration (the field's concentration is interrupted only by its complete destruction). Spells that require a target will target the living creature nearest to the field.$$Typical spells linked to an [Energy Transformation Field] are [Blindness/Deafness], [Fireball], [Suggestion], [Summon Monster I], or [Wall of Force]. Spells that have a costly material component or an XP cost cannot be linked to a field, but those with a costly focus can if the focus object is present within the field (typically sealed into a wall or in a secret compartment).$$Only [Mordenkainen's Disjunction], [Limited Wish], [Wish], or similar spells can destroy the [Energy Transformation Field]. Spells of lower level, such as [Dispel Magic] and [Greater Dispel Magic], are absorbed by it, and an [Antimagic Field] prevents it from absorbing magical energy within the field but does not otherwise hamper this spell. If two or more field spells share an overlapping area, each field has an equal chance of absorbing a spell effect in that area.$${{Material Component:}} Three drops of your blood, an eye from any humanoid, and 5,000 gp worth of powdered diamond.${{XP Cost:}} 250.

This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them.

On the creature's next action, it moves as close to you as it can get in a single round and offers you the object as a standard action. This spell allows you to act out of turn and accept the "gift" if the creature reaches you to hand you the object (assuming you have a free hand and can accept it). The subject defends itself normally and acts as it wishes on subsequent rounds, including attempting to get the object back if desired. If the subject is prevented from doing as the spell compels, the spell has no effect. For example, if the subject is paralyzed and cannot move or drop the item, nothing happens.

Upon casting this spell and touching a surface or inanimate object, you create an invisible rune like that created by the spell [Arcane Mark]. At any point during the spell's duration you can teleport (as the [Greater Teleport] spell) back to the mark as a swift action. This ends the spell's duration. After teleporting in this way, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. Unlike [Greater Teleport], however, [Evacuation Rune] affects the caster and no others.$$The mark created by this spell can be detected in the same ways that an invisible [Arcane Mark] can be. You are not alerted if the mark is dispelled or the object upon which it is inscribed is destroyed.

You have no knowledge of whether your mark has been moved or where, and upon teleporting to its location, you are subject to any adverse conditions. If the mark has been moved to another plane, any attempt to teleport to it fails.$$If the object inscribed with the [Evacuation Rune] is moved somewhere too small for you to appear or is otherwise covered by a solid body, you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location.

If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you take an additional 4d6 points of damage, and the teleport attempt simply fails.$${{Material Component:}} The blood of an owl, hawk, or eagle.

In one stands a demon, and in the other stands your willing subject. After an hour-long ritual incantation, you pull a roiling black cloud of demonic essence out of the demon and channel it into the willing recipient.}$$You transfer a portion of a demon's essence into a willing creature, enhancing one of its ability scores or skills. The demon must be either allied and willing or captured and constrained (as if by a [Planar Binding] spell). An unwilling demon can make a Will save to negate the effects of the spell.$$Both the recipient and the donor demon must remain within specially prepared circles inscribed on the floor for the entire casting time. These circles are similar to summoning circles and can be integrated into a summoning circle without impacting the function of either spell, but neither the demon nor the recipient need be summoned specifically into the circle for this spell's circle — each needs only to stand within it during the casting.$$The benefit granted by this spell can be applied to one of the recipient's ability scores (as an enhancement bonus) or to one of his skills (as a competence bonus), as you designate. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed, and the effect cannot be dispelled except by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell.$$If you wish, you can increase the save DC for this spell by allowing the demon power over the target. The specific concessions you can make to the demon and the corresponding increases to the save DC are given below.*{{+1 Increase.}} The donor demon can track the recipient's location and condition, effectively gaining the effect of a constant [Status] spell on it.*{{+3 Increase.}} The demon can see through the recipient's eyes and hear through its ears.*{{+5 Increase.}} The demon can telepathically communicate with the recipient as if by [Rary's Telepathic Bond].*{{+7 Increase.}} The demon can use [Demand] on the recipient once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals your caster level at the time you cast [Extract Gift]).$$The effects of the concessions are cumulative, but the save DC increases do not stack. Thus, allowing the demon to track the recipient, use its senses, and communicate with it telepathically would increase the save DC by 5. Increasing the save DC in this manner is an evil act, since it grants the demon more than the usual opportunity to work its evil. Thus, using this option adds the evil descriptor to the spell.*{{Ability Bonus.}} The recipient gains an enhancement bonus to one ability score of your choice. The value of this bonus depends on your caster level and the abilities of the donor demon, as given below.^The maximum value of the bonus you can grant is one-fourth of your caster level (rounded down). Thus, you could grant the recipient up to a +2 enhancement bonus at 9th level, or up to a +5 bonus at 20th level. You can always choose to grant a bonus lower than your maximum.^The donor demon's ability modifier for the corresponding score must be at least twice that of the granted bonus. Thus, to grant a +2 bonus to Dexterity, you must extract essence from a demon with a Dexterity score of at least 18 (such as a marilith). To grant a +5 bonus to Charisma, you need a demon with a Charisma score of at least 30 (such as a lilitu).*{{Skill Bonus.}} The recipient gains a competence bonus on checks made with one skill of your choice. The value of this bonus depends on your caster level and the abilities of the donor demon, as given below.^The maximum value of the bonus you can grant is one-half your caster level (rounded down). Thus, you could grant the recipient up to a +4 enhancement bonus at 9th level, or up to a +10 bonus at 20th level. You can always choose to grant a bonus lower than your maximum.^The donor demon's ranks in the selected skill must be at least twice the granted bonus. Thus, to grant a +5 bonus on [Disable Device] checks, you must extract essence from a demon with at least 10 ranks in [Disable Device] (such as a babau). To grant a +10 bonus on [Bluff] checks, you need a demon with at least 20 ranks in [Bluff] (such as a balor).$${{Material Component:}} The circles in which the donor and recipient stand during the casting must be inscribed with expensive paints made from powdered diamonds, cold iron, blood, and various rare and exotic pigments. Each circle must also be decorated with five flawless sapphires, which serve as conduits between the donor demon and the recipient. The total cost of these pigments and gems depends on the nature and magnitude of the bonus to be imparted. For an ability bonus, the cost equals the bonus squared times 1,000 gp (1,000 gp for +1, 4,000 gp for +2, 9,000 gp for +3, 16,000 gp for +4, and 25,000 gp for +5). For a skill bonus, the cost equals the bonus squared times 100 gp (100 gp for +1, 400 gp for +2, 900 gp for +3, 1,600 gp for +4, 2,500 gp for +5, 3,600 gp for +6, 4,900 gp for +7, 6,400 gp for +8, 8,100 gp for +9, and 10,000 gp for +10).${{XP Cost:}} You must spend XP equal to 1/25 the required cost of the material components when you cast this spell.

Normal ranged attacks through the hurricane's windy area are impossible, and even heavier projectiles such as siege weapons and giant boulders take a –8 penalty on the attack roll.$$Creatures who move inside the spell's area suffer effects depending on their size and whether they're airborne. Each creature must make a saving throw at the beginning of its turn or when it enters the affected area.$$Medium or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked 1d4×10 feet away from the [Eye of the Hurricane]'s center and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet traveled in this manner.

Although the area is centered on you, you're not within the wind. If you move, the [Eye of the Hurricane] moves as well to keep you in the center. If you cast [Eye of the Hurricane] so that creatures are inside the eye when the spell begins, they must make Fortitude saves when your movement brings the area of wind upon them. Thereafter, if you move the spell area into a square occupied by another creature, that creature makes a Fortitude save at the beginning of its next turn (assuming the windy area of the spell is still on it).

It is further immune to effects that would cause it to be dazed, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, staggered, or stunned. The subject remains conscious at –1 to –9 hit points and can take a single action each round while in that state, and does not lose hit points for acting. If any of the above conditions were in effect on the subject at the time of casting, they are suspended for the spell's duration. (Thus, an unconscious subject becomes conscious and functional.) When the spell ends, any effects suspended by the spell that have not expired in the interim (such as the fatigued condition, which normally requires 8 hours of rest to recover from) return. Effects that expired during the duration of this spell do not resume when it ends.$$In addition to these effects, the subject gains the benefit of the [Endurance] feat for the duration of the spell.

The energy of this zone clings to creatures and objects, granting them a shield against spells. All creatures in the spell's area gain spell resistance of 11 + caster level for as long as they remain in the area. If a creature already has spell resistance higher than this amount, this spell does not affect it. Unlike personal spell resistance, this spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. A creature loses this spell resistance when it leaves the spell's area, and gains it again if it returns.

The fires you enter and move between must be at least as big around as you are. Fire elementals and other fire creatures are not considered "fires" for the purpose of this spell, nor are sources of great heat, such as pools of lava.$$Once in a fire, you instantly know the locations of all suitable fires within long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level) and can transport yourself to one of them. Each transport counts as a full-round action. With each casting of the spell, you can transport yourself once per caster level. If a fire's location doesn't offer enough space for you (for example, a fire contained inside a furnace too small to hold you or a fire already occupied by a big cauldron), it is not a viable destination and you don't sense its location. If a fire rests on a surface that can't support you, it is still a viable destination and you suffer the appropriate consequences if you transport yourself to it. For example, if you transport yourself into a fire burning in a pit full of oil, you fall into the oil when you arrive there.$$[Fire Stride] provides no protection against fire, so it is advisable to obtain such protection before using the spell.

The wings allow you to fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor), with good maneuverability. You can charge but not run while flying, and you cannot carry more than a light load aloft. Using a [Fire Wings] spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so you can take other actions normally.$$If the spell duration expires while you are aloft, you descend at a rate of 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds, then fall the rest of the distance if you haven't already landed.

The effect lasts for 1 round, although the water created by the spell does not disappear after 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground within the area cannot move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a [Concentration] check (DC 20 + spell level) to successfully cast a spell.$$The force of the water and debris deals those caught in the area 1d6 points of nonlethal damage plus another 1d6 points per five caster levels (maximum 4d6). Any creature or object that is not soundly secured is pushed violently to the outer edge of the area. If this forces the creature or object into a solid surface, it takes 8d6 points of damage. A creature holding onto a sturdy object can make a DC 20 Strength check to avoid being moved. A creature not already holding onto such an object can make a DC 20 Reflex save or [Swim] check to grab one. A creature of Huge size or larger can make a DC 30 Strength check to dig in its feet and simply withstand the oncoming wave. A creature that fails any of these checks falls prone in addition to being swept away.$$The specific effect and aftereffects of a [Flashflood] spell on the environment depend on the nature of the terrain where it is cast. When the spell is completed, a total volume of 100,000 cubic feet of water (400 5-foot squares, in a 120-ft. cone, 10 feet deep) is left behind. This water behaves like ordinary water — draining away and leaving puddles in most cases, or perhaps forming a shallow lake or pond. Unless the caster has taken care to create the [Flashflood] in a cleared area, however, the water left behind is full of debris, dirt, and perhaps a few corpses. Such water is unfit to drink.*{{Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel:}} The sudden surge of water knocks down support beams, but otherwise has no real effect, aside from filling the tunnel with water to a depth of 10 feet. If the area is insufficient to support 100,000 cubic feet of water, the water level rises above 10 feet until the entire volume is filled, or it spills outward from the confines of the original 400 squares. What happens is based on the layout of the area. In the case of level terrain, the water simply drains away over the course of a minute or so, leaving pools in depressions from which it cannot drain. When the ground in a tunnel is not level, the water might flood sections of the tunnel. In such cases, determine whether the flooded area is sufficient to contain the entire volume of water created — and, if not, how deeply the water floods the next level up. Any creatures caught in water over their heads might drown.^For example, Miyish casts [Flashflood] in the dungeon of a ruined castle. The dungeon's total volume is only 40,000 cubic feet (160 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling). The remaining 60,000 cubic feet of water has to go somewhere, so it rushes up and out the entrance to the dungeon. Since the terrain above the dungeon is another level of the castle, and is basically watertight, the water collects up here. The total volume of this level is 80,000 cubic feet (320 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling), leaving 20,000 cubic feet of air. Since the water has nowhere to go but up, and it has gone as high as it can, the water on this level is 7-1/2 feet deep (60,000 cubic feet divided by 8,000 — the square footage of 320 5-foot squares). If Miyish can't swim or breathe water, he has made a grave tactical error by casting [Flashflood] in an area too small to contain it.*{{Cliffs:}} Casting [Flashflood] at the base of a cliff has no effect on the cliff. Casting [Flashflood] from the top of a cliff can force creatures and objects over the edge, so that they take falling damage.*{{Open Ground:}} Creatures on open ground are safest from the worst effects of [Flashflood]. They might be knocked prone by the force of the water, or even swept 120 feet (24 squares) away, but they are not in any particular danger of drowning or being crushed.*{{Structure(s):}} Any structure standing on open ground takes 60 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden building, but not a structure built of stone, masonry, or reinforced masonry. Hardness reduces this damage, but it isn't halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half). The debris is swept away by the [Flashflood].*{{River, Lake, or Marsh:}} The river, lake, or marsh overflows its banks, though with rivers the effect is transitory. In the case of lakes and marshes, determine how much the body of water overflows, given the 100,000 cubic feet of water added to it. Only calculate this amount if the total surface area of the lake or marsh is less than 40,000 square feet — and even then, it's only academic unless it is important to determine whether something on the shore gets wet.

Once [Foresight] is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. Thus, if you are the subject of the spell, you would be warned in advance if a rogue were about to attempt a sneak attack on you, or if a creature were about to leap out from a hiding place, or if an attacker were specifically targeting you with a spell or ranged weapon. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself — duck, jump right, close your eyes, and so on — and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.$$When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.$${{Arcane Material Component:}} A hummingbird's feather.

The figure is your size and clearly made of wood, but it resembles you sufficiently that anyone who knows you can recognize your features in its face. The figure can emerge from the tree you touch, or from any tree of the same type within the spell's range.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing in its location, and you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action anytime during your turn. While you are using its senses, your own body is considered blinded and deafened.$$If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the [Forest Child] instead of from you. It cannot, however, cast any spells on itself. Spells cast through the [Forest Child] function normally in all respects except for the point of origin.$$A [Forest Child] has a number of hit points equal to your character level. If you use it to attack physically, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls, and it deals damage equal to your unarmed damage.$$As a standard action, you can change places with your duplicate. (Although the spell itself is a transmutation, this usage is a conjuration (teleportation) effect.) Making use of this option reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 5 rounds. If you have fewer than 5 rounds of duration left, you cannot invoke this ability.$$If you cast this spell along with both [Forest Eyes] and [Forest Voice], the duration of [Forest Child] doubles, and its range quadruples.$${{Material Component:}} A small hardwood replica of yourself, which costs 10 gp to create.

This spell doesn't grant extra skill points.$${{Arcane Material Component:}} A few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a fox.

Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects (for example, from the [Mage Armor] spell) still apply. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to poison and critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in [Gaseous Form]. (This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats [Silent Spell], [Still Spell], and [Eschew Materials].)

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction. Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the [Gate].$$The [Gate] itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.$$A [Gate] has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the [Gate] from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.*{{Planar Travel.}} As a mode of planar travel, a [Gate] spell functions much like a [Plane Shift] spell, except that the [Gate] opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a [Gate] from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you — anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A [Gate] cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.^You could position a [Gate] in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane. Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter.^You may hold the [Gate] open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.*{{Calling Creatures.}} The second effect of the [Gate] spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the [Gate] to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the [Gate], although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a [Gate] that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).^If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual — for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin — you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.^A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.^If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the [Lesser Planar Ally] spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in "livestock" rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.^Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.$${{Note:}} When you use a calling spell such as [Gate] to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, [Gate] is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon.${{XP Cost:}} 1,000 (only for the calling creatures function).

This effect moves with the recipient and does not affect his vision.

The foe with the gaze attack does not have concealment from the recipient (see {Gaze Attacks}, DMG 294). The recipient gets no additional protection from averting his eyes while the spell lasts, though he can shut his eyes and entirely avoid the gaze.

You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a [Ghost Sound] spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting.

You gain the incorporeal subtype for the duration of the spell, providing you with the following abilities and characteristics.$$You have no physical body while in this state. You can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. You are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells, including touch spells, or magic weapons, you have a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). Nondamaging spell effects affect you normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (such as [Implosion]) or they create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (such as a [Web] or [Wall of Stone] spell).$$Your attacks while in [Ghostform] pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as [Mage Armor]) work normally against you. Nonmagical attacks you make with a melee weapon have no effect on corporeal targets, and any melee attack you make with a magic weapon against a corporeal target has a 50% miss chance, except for attacks you make with a ghost touch weapon, which are made normally (no miss chance). Spells you cast while in [Ghostform] affect corporeal targets normally, including spells that require you to make an attack roll (such as rays or melee touch spells).$$Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is also incorporeal as long as it remains in your possession. An object that you relinquish loses its incorporeal quality (and you lose the ability to manipulate the object). If you use a thrown weapon or a ranged weapon, the projectile becomes corporeal as soon as it is fired and can affect a corporeal target normally (no miss chance). Magic items you possess work normally with respect to their effects on you or on another target.$$As an incorporeal creature, you have no natural armor bonus but have a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even if your Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus).$$You can enter or pass through solid objects while in [Ghostform], but you must remain adjacent to the object's exterior, and so you cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than your own. You can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to your current location, but enemies have total concealment from you while you are inside an object. In order to see farther from the object you are in and attack normally, you must emerge. While inside an object, you have total cover, but when you attack a creature outside the object you have cover only, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at you as you attack. You cannot pass through a force effect.$$You can pass through and operate in water as easily as you do in air. You cannot fall or take falling damage. You cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can you be tripped or grappled. In fact, you cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are you subject to such actions. You have no weight while in [Ghostform] and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.$$You move silently and cannot be heard with [Listen] checks if you don't wish to be while in [Ghostform]. You have no Strength score while incorporeal, so your Dexterity modifier applies to both your melee attacks and ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as [Scent] and [Blindsight], are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to you. You have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when you cannot see.

When cast, the spell searches a radius of 50 feet for the lingering notes of a tune played there within the last day. It records these notes and reverberations. At your verbal command, "Play," the [Ghostharp] replays the music. The tune repeats until you command it to stop, or until its duration comes to an end. The [Ghostharp] does not record conversations.

A [Glyph of Warding] can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.$$You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind (such as aberration, drow, or red dragon). Glyphs can also be set with respect to Good, Evil, Law, or Chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.$$When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.$$Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. [Mislead], [Polymorph], and [Nondetection] (and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't.$$[Read Magic] allows you to identify a [Glyph of Warding] with a DC 13 [Spellcraft] check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored). The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to you depend on your deity. He or she might also make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules in the {Dungeon Master's Guide}.$${{Note:}} Magic traps such as [Glyph of Warding] are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the [Search] skill to find the glyph and [Disable Device] to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for [Glyph of Warding]. Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.*{{Blast Glyph.}} A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.*{{Spell Glyph.}} You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder.

The construct's body becomes covered in a thin skin of clay, flesh, iron, or stone (depending on the type of [Golem Immunity] chosen), and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the construct, depending on the type of [Golem Immunity] conferred by the spell.*{{Clay:}} A [Move Earth] spell drives the construct back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage to it. A [Disintegrate] spell slows the construct (as the [Slow] spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage.

If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.*{{Iron:}} A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the construct (as the [Slow] spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the construct and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The construct gets no saving throw against fire effects. The construct is affected as an iron construct by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a [Rusting Grasp] spell, regardless of its original composition.*{{Stone:}} A [Transmute Rock to Mud] spell slows the construct (as the [Slow] spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while [Transmute Mud to Rock] acts as a [Total Repair] spell. A [Stone to Flesh] spell does not actually change the construct's structure but negates its immunity to magic for 1 full round.

A successful Reflex save means the creature takes only 4d6 points of damage and the spell ends.$$If the creature fails its save, it takes 8d6 points of damage and becomes "swalowed" by the mouth, dragged beneath the ground.

If successful, the creature appears prone in its original space and the spell ends. An ally in or adjacent to the creature's original space can use the Aid Another action to help unearth it; a successful DC 10 Strength check grants a +2 bonus on the creature's next Reflex save to escape.$$You can place this spell's effect only on a horizontal area of dirt or stone at least 10 feet thick. Any creature more than 5 feet off the ground can't be affected by this spell.

The [Guardian Spirit] remains active for 1 minute, and then its power is expended and the spell ends.$$No creature can be the target of more than one [Guardian Spirit] spell simultaneously. If a second is cast before the first has been discharged, the second spell dissipates to no effect.$${{Essentia:}} For every point of essentia you invest in this spell, the bonus provided by the spirit improves by 1.

The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.*{{Fog.}} Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including [Darkvision], beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.*{{Arcane Locks.}} All doors in the warded area are arcane locked. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.*{{Webs.}} Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the [Web] spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the [Guards and Wards] spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for [Web]. Spell Resistance: No.*{{Confusion.}} Where there are choices in direction — such as a corridor intersection or side passage — a minor confusion-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment, mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: Yes.*{{Lost Doors.}} One door per caster level is covered by a [Silent Image] to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: No.$$In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.*[Dancing Lights] in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the [Guards and Wards] spell lasts. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.*A [Magic Mouth] in two places. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.*A [Stinking Cloud] in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the [Guards and Wards] spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for [Stinking Cloud]. Spell Resistance: No.*A [Gust of Wind] in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.*A [Suggestion] in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the [Suggestion] mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.$$The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A [Dispel Magic] cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful [Mordenkainen's Disjunction] destroys the entire [Guards and Wards] effect.$${{Material Component:}} Burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, and a small amount of umber hulk blood.${{Focus:}} A small silver rod.

The shaking hand gets one grapple attack per round. Its grapple bonus against another magic hand is your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively), +9 for the hand's Strength score (29), +4 for being Large.$$Once grappled, a magic hand can only escape the shaking hand by making an opposed grapple check, unless the duration of the grappled hand exceeds the duration of the shaking hand. In cases where no Strength score is given, assume the magic hand has a Strength score of 17 + twice the level of the spell. Once a grapple is broken, nothing prevents your shaking hand from attempting another grapple attack.$$For example, a wizard uses [Halaster's Shaking Hand] to grapple a sorcerer's [Bigby's Forceful Hand], rolls a 10 on a d20, adds +4 for his own Intelligence score (18), adds +9 for the hand's Strength score (29), and adds +4 for the hand's size (Large), for a total of 27. The sorcerer seeks to break the handshake; he rolls a 14 on a d20, adds +4 for his own Charisma score (18), adds +8 for the hand's Strength score (27), and adds +4 for the hand's size (Large) for a total of 30. The "handshake" (grapple) lasts for at least 1 more round. If, however, the sorcerer had rolled a 15 or higher, the handshake would have been broken, at least until the shaking hand successfully grappled the forceful hand again.

Undermountain, the greatest dungeon of Faerûn, is believed to have been enclosed within the largest teleport cage in existence in the Realms by means of this combinatorial effect.$$When this spell is cast within a teleport cage, such translocation spells simply transport all affected creatures and objects to another random location within the teleport cage. For example, if a wizard casts [Teleport] within the confines of Undermountain, the encompassing teleport cage would cause him to appear at another random location within the great dungeon.$$When a caster outside the area encompassed by a teleport cage attempts to [Teleport] into it, this spell redirects his destination to another random location reachable by the spell. For example, if a 9th-level wizard in the city above attempted to [Teleport] into the depths of Undermountain, the encompassing teleport cage would cause him to appear at another random location within 900 miles of the place where he cast the spell.$${{Material Component:}} Diamond dust worth 1,000 gp.

The sword's hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other factors are not affected. A [Hardening] spell does not in any way affect a substance's resistance to other forms of transformation.

The spell has five charges when cast. Once per round as a standard action, a single allied creature within 30 feet can drain one charge from the [Healing Circle]. The first charge so drained functions as a [Cure Critical Wounds] spell, the second as a [Cure Serious Wounds] spell, the third as a [Cure Moderate Wounds] spell, and the fourth as a [Cure Light Wounds] spell, and the final charge heals only 5 points of damage. A creature must be conscious to draw a charge from the [Healing Circle].$$The spell effect delivered by each charge functions as if you had personally cast the associated spell. Thus, the first charge heals 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20), and so on.

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. (Magic items' saving throws are covered in the {Dungeon Master's Guide}.) An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.$$A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.$$On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing more damage, as shown on the table below.#{{Round}};{{Metal Temperature}};{{Damage}}:1;Warm;None:2;Hot;1d4 points:3–5;Searing;2d4 points:6;Hot;1d4 points:7;Warm;None#Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a [Heat Metal] spell indicates 2 points of fire damage and the subject is hit by a [Ray of Frost] in the same round and takes 3 points of cold damage, it winds up taking no fire damage and only 1 point of cold damage. If cast underwater, [Heat Metal] deals half damage and boils the surrounding water.$$[Heat Metal] counters and dispels [Chill Metal].

It might appear as a house-sized boulder in a rocky or mountainous area, as a sand dune in the desert, as a densely tangled thicket, a grassy knoll, or even a mighty tree. The lodge also obscures all telltale signs of habitation, including any smoke, light, or sound coming from within.$$At any distance of more than 30 feet, the lodge is indistinguishable from natural terrain. Any creature approaching within 30 feet is entitled to a DC 30 [Survival] check to spot the [Hidden Lodge] as an artificial dwelling and not a natural part of the landscape.$${{Focus:}} The focus of an [Alarm] spell (silver wire and a tiny bell), if this benefit is to be included in the [Hidden Lodge] (see [Leomund's Secure Shelter] for more information).

If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of –2.$$While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude (see {Influencing NPC Attitudes}, page 72). This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular request.$$A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.

For instance, if you are lawful neutral, you cast [Iconic Manifestation] as a lawful spell. If you are chaotic good, you can cast [Iconic Manifestation] as a good or chaotic spell (not both).

Invoking the spell's effect requires a swift action and requires you to expend one daily use of your [Wild Shape] ability. You temporarily acquire the celestial template (MM 31) if you are good, the fiendish template (MM 107) if you are evil, the anarchic template (Manual of the Planes 198) if you are chaotic, or the axiomatic template (Manual of the Planes 197) if you are lawful. (If your campaign does not use Manual of the Planes, you can approximate the axiomatic template by using the celestial template, and substituting lawful for good and chaotic for evil. You can approximate the anarchic template by using the fiendish template and making the same substitution.)$$Once invoked, this transformation lasts 1 minute per caster level. You can still use your [Wild Shape] ability to take on other forms without negating this spell.$${{Note:}} Adding a template "on the fly" can dramatically slow game-play. If you anticipate using this spell, write down the relevant adjustments — both to your normal form and to any animal, plant, or elemental forms you regularly assume — before play begins.

An [Icy Claw] never provokes attacks of opportunity. It cannot push through a [Wall of Force] or enter an [Antimagic Field], but it is affected by [Prismatic Wall] or [Prismatic Sphere]. A [Disintegrate] spell or a successful [Dispel Magic] destroys it.$$An [Icy Claw] attacks an opponent of your choice once per round, and its attack bonus equals your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for a wizard or sorcerer, respectively) +10 for the claw's Strength score (31).

If it successfully damages a Medium or smaller foe, it attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity, with a grapple check bonus equal to your caster level +10. On a successful grapple check, an [Icy Claw] deals normal damage (see above). The claw ignores effects intended to mask or conceal the selected target, including [Darkness], [Invisibility], [Displacement], [Hide in Plain Sight], and the like. Directing an [Icy Claw] to a new target is a free action.$${{Arcane Focus:}} A white dragon's talon.

In addition, any living creature struck by the [Incarnum Weapon] takes 1 point of Wisdom drain (a successful Will save negates the Wisdom drain). The weapon takes a form based on your alignment: battleaxe (chaotic), flail (evil), warhammer (good), or longsword (law). Casters can choose any weapon whose alignment is not opposed to theirs (neutral casters can choose any of the four weapons). Regardless of the weapon's form, it threatens a critical only on a 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit.$$The [Incarnum Weapon] strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon; for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers.$$Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to.$$An [Incarnum Weapon] cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but it can be affected by any effect that would affect a spell or a soulmeld. An [Incarnum Weapon]'s AC against touch attacks is 11 (10 + size bonus for Small object).$${{Essentia:}} Every point of essentia you invest in the [Incarnum Weapon] adds a +1 insight bonus on the weapon's attack rolls and damage rolls and expands the weapon's critical threat range by 1. For example, an [Incarnum Weapon] spell with 2 points of essentia invested would have a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and would have a critical threat range of 18–20.

The smoke obscures all sight as a [Fog Cloud] does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 4d6 points of fire damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can make Reflex saves each round to take half damage.$$As with a [Cloudkill] spell, the smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud (actually its point of origin) move as much as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the remainder's spread thereafter.$$As with [Fog Cloud], wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can't be cast underwater.

The claws are treated as primary melee attacks with a natural weapon, and the wing attacks are treated as secondary attacks with a natural weapon. When making attacks with these claws and wings, the invested creature has a base attack bonus equal to its character level (or HD, if the invested creature has a level adjustment). When taking a full attack action and using only the natural weapons granted by the aspect of tyranny, the secondary attacks are made with only a –2 penalty rather than the normal –5. Because these are natural attacks, the invested creature cannot make multiple attacks because of a high base attack bonus.*{{Aspect of Pestilence.}} When the invested creature chooses to manifest the Aspect of Pestilence, it can, as a standard action, release a cloud of disease-ridden air. Creatures within 10 feet of the subject when it generates this effect must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw against the spell's DC or take 2 points of Strength damage.*{{Aspect of Terror.}} When the invested creature chooses to manifest the Aspect of Terror, it can, as a standard action, release a powerful wave of fear. Creatures within 10 feet of the subject when it generates this effect must succeed on a Will saving throw against the spell's DC or become frightened for 2 rounds. This wave of fear is a mind-affecting fear effect.$$The subject gains immunity to poison and resistance to fire 20. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of [Investiture of the Pit Fiend]).$$While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute.$${{Material Component:}} A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.

The spines can be directed against different targets if desired, but all targets must be within 30 feet of one another.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.$$Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.$$Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as [Bless] that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.$$See Table 8–5: {Attack Roll Modifiers} and Table 8–6: {Armor Class Modifiers}, page 151, for the effects of [Invisibility] on combat.$$[Invisibility] can be made permanent (on objects only) with a [Permanency] spell.$${{Arcane Material Component:}} An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.

It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut). If used to open a arcane locked door, the spell does not remove the [Arcane Lock] but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. [Knock] does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. A 3rd-level caster can cast a [Knock] spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-foot-by-7-foot door). Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or quadruple locked, opening it requires two [Knock] spells.

Weaknesses include vulnerability to an energy type.$$For example, suppose a 7th-level cleric casts [Know Opponent] on a black-armored warrior, choosing to learn one strength and two weaknesses. The warrior fails his save, and the DM informs the cleric's player that the opponent has the ability to drain energy (a strength), is adversely affected by sunlight, and can be repelled by a holy symbol (both weaknesses).

The animal must be your size category or larger. To any observer, you appear to leap and phase into the animal; you are gone, while the animal remains. For all intents and purposes, you no longer exist while merged with the animal, and you cannot be detected or affected by anything as long as you remain within it.$$While melded with the animal, you mentally direct its actions. You can make it attack, run, or take any other action it could normally physically accomplish. However, because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it can undertake actions normally beyond its own instincts (such as manipulating objects with its claws or mouth). Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger) are ignored. You receive direct sensory input from the creature using its normal senses and skill modifiers.$$You cannot take any mental actions while within the animal other than directing it or dismissing the effect (such that you cannot manifest a psionic power or cast a spell, even if it has no components).$$Injury to the animal has no effect on you.

If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information.

If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be silver or electrum (a valuable metal). The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp.

The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.$$The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise — it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).$$The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an [Alarm] spell. Finally, an [Unseen Servant] is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter. The secure shelter contains rude furnishings — eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.$${{Material Component:}} A square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the [Unseen Servant] spell (string and a bit of wood) if this benefit is to be included.${{Focus:}} The focus of the [Alarm] spell (silver wire and a tiny bell) if this benefit is to be included.

However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.$$The temperature inside the hut is 70°F if the exterior temperature is between 0°F and 100°F. An exterior temperature below 0° or above 100° lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis (thus, if it's –20° outside, inside the hut it's 50°). The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.$$The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within.

If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).$$You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to the complex (spy on our enemies, protect us on our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.$$The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.$$A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.$$A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, the DM may halve or even waive the payment.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.$$To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.$$The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A [Dimensional Anchor] cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see [Magic Circle against Evil]) to make the trap more secure.$$If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The DM assigns your check a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.$$Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions (such as "Wait here" or "Defend this area against attack"), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.$$When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, [Lesser Planar Binding] is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental.

Then the light of a malevolent evil flares in the host's eyes as it rushes to attack, and you know you have only one chance.}$$When this spell is cast on a possessed creature, the possessing spirit is temporarily bound within its host and inextricably locked to that host's life force. If the [Lifebound] creature is slain, both the host and the possessing spirit die.$$While under the effect of this spell, the host creature automatically falls under the complete control of the possessing spirit (ECS 101). For the purpose of combat, the [Lifebound] creature uses its own attacks and special abilities (with any enhancements provided by the possession), but can make use of any of the possessing spirit's spell-like, psi-like, or supernatural abilities, even if the possessing spirit normally does not have use of those abilities while possessing the host creature. The [Lifebound] creature makes use of the possessing spirit's abilities in ways that make sense for its own form. For example, an Inspired that has a tsucora quori spirit would gain that creature's terrifying sting supernatural ability, but would use the ability through its natural attacks or weapon attacks (the Inspired's choice).$$The possessing spirit takes no damage from attacks directed at the host creature. However, if a [Lifebound] host is slain (taken to –10 hit points), the possessing spirit is instantly destroyed. The host creature can then be raised or resurrected if such magic is available.$$Many outsiders are tied to the energy of their plane, and so are never permanently destroyed. For example, this spell could destroy the personality and memories of a particular quori spirit, but that spirit's energy returns to Dal Quor to eventually form a new quori of the same kind. However, a spirit destroyed by this spell cannot reform for a number of weeks (as reckoned on the Material Plane) equal to its HD.$$The magic needed to bind a possessing spirit to a host body is both powerful and unstable. As a result, neither the caster of this spell nor the possessing spirit or host creature knows the spell's duration, which is rolled in secret by the DM. Each round as a full-round action, the [Lifebound] creature can make a special Will save (DC equal to spell's save DC minus possessing spirit's HD + your caster level). A quori spirit possessing an Inspired host can add the levels of the host body to its HD for the purpose of resisting this spell. If the spirit succeeds on the save, it can abandon the host body as a free action. If it chooses not to abandon the host, the possessing spirit remains bound.$${{Material Component:}} A white diamond of at least 500 gp value for every HD possessed by the possessing spirit. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the binding is attempted. The gem is destroyed if the [Lifebound] host is slain, but can be reused if the possessing spirit escapes destruction. (Although creatures have no concept of level or HD as such, the value of the gem needed to bind an individual spirit can be researched.)

You can fly at a speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability (or 30 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor, or carry a medium or heavy load). If you already have a fly speed of 40 feet or greater, your fly speed improves by 10 feet, and your maneuverability improves to good (unless it's already better than that).$$While airborne, you can use a swift action each round to fire a bolt of magical lightning as a ranged touch attack against any other airborne target within 60 feet. This attack deals 1 point of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20 points) and reduces the target's fly speed to 1/2 normal for the duration of the spell. This speed reduction doesn't stack, so attacking the same target multiple times yields no extra reduction in fly speed (but continues to deal damage).$$Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate one [Lightning Bolt] (as the spell) as a standard action. Doing so ends the duration of [Lord of the Sky], and if you do not have a natural fly speed, you drift to the ground as per the fly spell.$${{Special:}} If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), this spell grants you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 if encumbered as described above). Dragonblooded casters who already have a fly speed of 60 feet or greater instead gain a +10-foot improvement to their fly speed.

You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of [Protection from Evil]), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.$$This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A [Magic Circle against Evil] can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the [Lesser Planar Binding], [Planar Binding], and [Greater Planar Binding] spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal [Protection from Evil] spell for that creature only.$$A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel ([Astral Projection], [Blink], [Dimension Door], [Etherealness], [Gate], [Plane Shift], [Shadow Walk], [Teleport], and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a [Dimensional Anchor] spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.$$You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 [Spellcraft] check. The DM makes this check secretly. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.$$A successful diagram allows you to cast a [Dimensional Anchor] spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the [Lesser Planar Binding] spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram — even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.$$This spell is not cumulative with [Protection from Evil] and vice versa.$${{Arcane Material Component:}} A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot-diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the [Magic Jar]. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.$$To cast the spell, the [Magic Jar] must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.$$While in the [Magic Jar], you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)$$For example, if two 10th-level characters are attacking a hill giant (12 HD) and four ogres (4 HD), you could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within range, all powered by positive energy. You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.$$Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by [Protection from Evil] or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the [Magic Jar] unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the [Magic Jar], and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.$$If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the [Magic Jar]. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. For example, a fish's body breathes water and a troll's body regenerates. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.$$As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the [Magic Jar] if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.$$If the host body is slain, you return to the [Magic Jar], if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.$$If the spell ends while you are in the [Magic Jar], you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the [Magic Jar] returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the [Magic Jar] or at the host's location.$${{Focus:}} A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp.

The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, [Magic Mouth] can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.$$The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: "Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack sits cross-legged within a distance of one foot." Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but [Invisibility] does. Silent movement or magical [Silence] defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, or when anyone says "Boo"). Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. For example, "Speak when any creature touches the statue" is an acceptable command if the creature is visible. A [Magic Mouth] cannot distinguish alignment, level, HD, or class except by external garb.$$The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a [Magic Mouth] to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.$$[Magic Mouth] can be made permanent with a [Permanency] spell.$${{Material Component:}} A small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth 10 gp.

The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.$$Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image's AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dexterity modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a [Fireball]).$$While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.$$An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)

When you cast the spell, gaze into a mirror, and specify the person you wish to contact, you see that creature as if gazing from the mirror closest to the creature. In order for the spell to function, the creature must be willing to communicate and be within 10 feet of a mirror.$$A particular sound (such as clarion horns, a single note, a chime, or the like) emanates from the distant mirror to announce your wish to converse. You choose this sound at the time of casting. If the target creature is present and wishes to converse, it need only gaze into the mirror and give mental or verbal acquiescence. Doing so allows the target to see and hear all that transpires within 10 feet of your mirror, within its normal limits of perception. You and the target can then speak and see through the mirror for the duration of the spell, as can any other creatures within 10 feet of the surface of either mirror.$$If the target is not present, or does not accept your attempt at communication within 5 rounds, or either mirror is broken, the spell ends. The two mirrors are ordinary in every respect except while used to communicate. During that time, each gives off a faint aura of divination.$${{Arcane Focus:}} One silvered glass or polished metal mirror worth at least 100 gp

On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of [Misdirection] is detected as if it were the other object. (Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect.) Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth.

You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible.

An illogical modified memory, such as the subject recalling how much it enjoyed drinking poison, is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. More useful applications of [Modify Memory] include implanting memories of friendly encounters with you (inclining the subject to act favorably toward you), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that it ever saw you or your party. The DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory is too nonsensical to significantly affect the subject.

The effect is a railless ribbon of glowing white translucent force like a glass strip. The strip |is up to 15 feet long per level and |can be from 3 to 20 feet wide as you decide. (You can vary the width over the ribbon's length if you want.) It sticks to its endpoints unshakably, even if these endpoints are in midair.$$At the time of casting, you designate up to one creature per caster level to receive extra protection while standing on or moving along the [Moon Path]. Protected creatures gain the benefit of a [Sanctuary] effect. This functions like the 1st-level spell [Sanctuary] except that the save DC is 15 + your Wisdom modifier, and any subject of the spell who attacks breaks the [Sanctuary] effect for all subjects. Protected creatures also stick to the top of the [Moon Path] as though they have received [Spider Climb] spells. A creature loses both benefits immediately when it leaves the path.$$Unlike a [Wall of Force], a [Moon Path] can be dispelled. It is otherwise similar to a [Wall of Force] in that it needs no supports and it is immune to damage of all kinds. A [Disintegrate] spell blasts a hole in the path 10 feet square, leaving the rest of the path intact. (If the [Moon Path] is 10 feet wide or less, this merely creates a 10-foot gap.) A hit from a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or [Mordenkainen's Disjunction] destroys a [Moon Path]. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through a [Moon Path], although [Dimension Door], [Teleport], and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures. Gaze attacks cannot operate through a [Moon Path].$$A [Moon Path] must be straight, continuous, and unbroken when formed. If its surface would be interrupted by any object or creature, the spell fails. The bridge version of the spell must be created flat. The stair version cannot rise or descend any more sharply than 45 degrees.$${{Arcane Material Component:}} A white handkerchief.

A lycanthrope in animal form can change out of it on the creature's next turn (spending a round in animal form). However, if it is still in the area of the spell, it must succeed on a Will save to do so.

The ship produced by this spell has even more room for cargo and passengers, contained within an extradimensional space.$$The entry point to this space is a hatch on the aft upper deck. Lifting the hatch reveals a set of wooden stairs, which descend about 6 feet to a horizontal shimmering in the air about 4 feet wide.

Bad weather or other marine hazards can still threaten the vessel, but even if it sinks, the passenger space remains safe and isolated (though exiting it might prove difficult).$$The ship is crewed by a minimum complement of spectral deckhands, which perform the basic tasks of maintenance. These, like the cabin servants, behave as [Unseen Servants] but can travel anywhere on board ship and can enter the extradimensional space if you so direct. The spectral deckhands respond to the direction of the helmsman, reducing the number of crew necessary to control the caravel to 1. If you do not provide a real helmsman, the ship will steer itself on the last course a living helmsman provided but will not be able to avoid collisions or hazards or adjust to changing conditions.$${{Focus:}} A miniature ship carved from mahogany, rigged with silk sails and gold thread, with a total value of 500 gp.

Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19–20 and a critical multiplier of ×2.$$The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one.

If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target. The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but [Dispel Magic], [Disintegrate], a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. The sword's AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).$$If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time [Mordenkainen's Sword] strikes it.

A creature who escapes burial ends up on top of the [Mudslide], mired in deep mud.$$After the initial slide, the [Mudslide] persists indefinitely, producing an area of deep bog (average depth 10 feet) until the water in it evaporates. It requires 4 squares of movement to enter 1 square of deep bog, and running or charging are impossible in the area. Underwater, the [Mudslide] remains indefinitely, producing an area of deep muck.

Creatures behind the wall receive cover.*{{Marshy or Low-Lying Site.}} In areas such as marsh, bog, swamp, or tundra, [Nature's Rampart] cannot raise a wall, but instead creates a water-filled ditch 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep.

A successful Reflex save halves the damage. Creatures who fail their saves are also buried (DMG 90). All squares within 20 feet of the center point are covered in heavy snow (DMG 94), which persists as long as ordinary snow would. A buried creature can free itself with a DC 20 Strength check as a full-round action, and can be dug free by others (a single creature working alone requires 1 minute to free a trapped creature). A trapped creature is unable to move, and cannot cast spells with somatic components, and any material components must be in hand.*{{Between 20 feet and 40 feet of the Center Point.}} Creatures take half as much damage from the impact of the avalanche as the creatures nearer the center point took (Reflex negates). Creatures who fail their saves must also resist the force of the snow moving past them as if they were being bull rushed. The snow has a +13 attack bonus (+5 for effective Strength of 20 and +8 for effectively being Huge) on the bull rush check, and it pushes characters away from the center point of the spell. All squares in the 20-foot to 40-foot ring are covered in snow (DMG 94), which persists as long as ordinary snow would.*{{Terrain and Structures.}} The avalanche uproots small trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of light rubble (DMG 91) even after the snow melts. Structures struck by an [Obedient Avalanche] take 1d6×10 points of damage.$$An [Obedient Avalanche] extinguishes all flames it touches, whether they are normal or magical.

You will likely face powerful NPCs or deadly traps in the next hour.$$If the roll fails, you get one of the two incorrect results, determined randomly by the DM, and you don't necessarily know that you failed because the DM rolls secretly.

A druid might see a white dove for safety, a dark cloud obscuring the sun for peril, and a forest fire for great danger. A cleric of Fharlanghn might get a vision of a straight road for safety, a crossroads for peril, and a washed-out bridge for great danger.$$Unlike the more powerful [Augury] spell, an [Omen of Peril] doesn't respond to a specific question. It indicates only the level of danger likely for the next hour, not what form the danger will take.$${{Focus:}} A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp.

When you cast [Pact of Return], you must state either a specific creature or a set of specific circumstances that you expect will be responsible for your death at some point within the spell's duration. If you name a creature, that creature does not have to deal the deathblow to trigger the release of the spell, but it must play an active part in your demise. If you name a set of circumstances, those circumstances must be reasonably specific or the spell will fail, leaving you well and truly dead. An acceptable set of circumstances would be, "I expect energy draining to play a pivotal role in my demise," whereas an unacceptable set would be, "I expect to die from loss of hit points." The DM decides whether the terms are acceptable.$$Whether the subject of your demise is a specific person or a specific source, you must die (that is, reach –10 hit points or lower) for the spell to take effect. If you do, and the circumstances of your demise are similar enough to those described when you cast the spell (DM's discretion), you are instantly resurrected (as per the [Resurrection] spell) with no level loss.$$You can have more than one [Pact of Return] active at the same time, each one to be triggered by a different foe or set of circumstances, but you must keep track of the total time that has elapsed for each.

Instead of a path of wind, you create a whirling mass of air.

Creatures must succeed on Fortitude saves as described in the [Gust of Wind] spell to avoid being checked or moved by the spell. Creatures blown over or moved by the wind are pushed in a random direction.$$The flying debris causes 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 10d4); this damage is subject to damage reduction, and creatures are allowed a Reflex save for half damage. If the debris is primarily composed of soft or very small objects, such as loose soil, the spell deals 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4).

Normally, unless controlled, the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo (DMG 158) is just what the plane's name implies: a roiling soup of energy and elements. Natives learn to control it or to inhabit areas that have enjoyed some measure of control for a long period, but visitors to areas of "raw" limbo must make a DC 16 Wisdom check to gain control over the dangerous roil.$$The [Perinarch] spell gives you automatic control of a radius of raw Limbo (an area not already stabilized or within some other creature's control) in close range. Control allows you to reshape the raw limbo as you desire, adding or subtracting one of the four basic elements once per round as a standard action. A favorite among travelers from the Material Plane is a chunk of earth surrounded by a small atmosphere of air.$$The effect of this spell overlaps with the control already (potentially) established with a Wisdom check. Your allies can give their control over to you concurrently with the spell being cast, if they so choose. Control cannot be wrested away from you while the spell is in effect (which is one of the best reasons to cast this spell, even if you have a high Wisdom). If you move more than 100 feet away from the area that you controlled, the order you imposed fades away.$$You are unable to achieve any works of complexity within an area you control, but you can mix two or three elements in a crude fashion; a few examples are provided below. You can attempt to seize control of a new area that already contains foes; however, foes can make a Reflex save to get out of the area.*{{Thick Barrier.}} You can "thicken" empty air with dust and rock, creating a zone around yourself and your allies that outside creatures must hack or force a way through. Their speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures.*{{Fiery Barrier.}} You can create a thick field of flame that deals 3d10 points of fire damage to any creature attempting to pass through it. The field also deals 3d10 points of fire damage for each round a creature lingers within it.*{{Complete Barrier.}} You can create a complete barrier of solid stone up to 1 foot thick encircling yourself and your allies, preventing access by any other than the most accomplished tunnelers. On the other hand, you can attempt to trap foes within their own bubble of solid stone.

If the target succeeds on an initial Will save, it recognizes that the images are not real, and the spell fails. If not, the phantasms strike the target, dealing 8 points of Wisdom damage and 8 points of Dexterity damage (4 points each on a successful Fortitude save). If the subject of a [1Phantasmal Assailant] succeeds in disbelieving and is wearing a helm of telepathy, the spell can be turned back upon you with the same effect.

Only you and the spell's subject can see the phantasmal creature, and the phantasm seems blurry and indistinct to you. If the target fails its Will saving throw, you designate a space that the phantasm appears to occupy. The subject must attack the phantasm, or move to be adjacent to it. A creature that attacks the phantasm is allowed an additional saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If moving up to the phantasm would cause the subject to cross dangerous terrain (such as a pool of lava), it does not move to be adjacent to the phantasm. It merely moves as close as it can and takes no further actions unless the phantasm moves to a space it can reach.$$As a move action, you can move a [Phantasmal Decoy] up to 60 feet in any direction. Because it's not real, a [Phantasmal Decoy] isn't affected by terrain that slows movement (although you can slow its progress voluntarily if you like to help maintain the facade of realism).

The very ground shifts and twists beneath the subject's feet, and the landscape moves of its own accord. The subject finds it nearly impossible to walk in a straight line.}$$The target of a [Phantasmal Disorientation] spell must make a Will save after this spell is cast to discern true landmarks from phantasmal ones. If the save succeeds, the creature moves and acts normally. If the save fails, it instead moves in a direction 90 degrees to either side (equal chance of going left or right), and cannot target any creature with ranged attacks or ranged spells. Because of the disorientation, the subject doesn't realize it's headed in the wrong direction until it meaningfully interacts with its environment (by making an attack or manipulating an object such as a door, for example). For the duration of the spell, an affected creature must succeed on a Will save each round to move normally.$$A [Phantasmal Disorientation] spell affects only the direction of movement and attacks made at range. Creatures subject to it can still make melee attacks, cast personal or touch spells, or otherwise act normally.

If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.$$If the subject of a [Phantasmal Killer] attack succeeds in disbelieving and is wearing a helm of telepathy, the beast can be turned upon you.

Your enemies move cautiously and pass up the opportunity to strike their foes, since the roar and confusion of the battle distracts them.$$All creatures within the area of the spell that fail their saving throws cannot make attacks of opportunity. In addition, all creatures within the area are considered flanked. A creature ignores these effects when it leaves the spell's area.

A creature that enters the area for the first time after the spell is cast must also make a saving throw to resist the effect.$$A [Phantom Battle] spell produces noise appropriate to a mob of creatures locked in battle. Anyone in the battle can plainly see that the conjured fighters are no threat, since they strike solely at other phantom warriors, but the din, tumult, and confusion make it difficult to focus on the true foes at hand. A creature that succeeds on its save can still see the spectral outline of the illusion, but is able to block out the distraction and fight as normal.$$When you cast this spell, you can choose for it not to affect a number of allies you designate less than or equal to your caster level.

The beating of its hooves grows almost deafening, and the world around you begins to shimmer.}$$If you cast this spell while mounted on your special mount or mount-sized fiendish companion, you tap into the energies normally released only when you summon or dismiss that creature, creating a short-range teleportation effect. Between a single pair of steps, you and your mount can teleport directly forward once, moving up to 5 feet per two caster levels. Many paladins use this spell to attack over rough terrain that would normally prevent a charge. Because this spell can be cast while your mount is moving, the creature can move part of its speed both before and after the spell takes effect. If you cast this spell in conjunction with [Master Cavalier] and [War-Mount], the three spells have a synergistic effect. See the [Master Cavalier] spell description for details.

The form of this [Phantom Foe] changes as appropriate whenever the target perceives a different threatening creature more dangerous than the last. This illusory double provides two effects.$$First, the subject believes it is being flanked by the [Phantom Foe] and the real creature the foe duplicates. Thus, the duplicated creature is always considered to be flanking the subject in melee. A creature that can't be flanked is immune to this aspect of the spell.$$Second, the subject of the spell is unable to determine that the [Phantom Foe] is not a real threat, and whenever the subject attempts to attack the creature duplicated by the [Phantom Foe], that creature benefits from a 50% miss chance against attacks from the subject of the spell. Because this miss chance comes from the subject's inability to tell the [Phantom Foe] from the original, it is rolled separately from any miss chance that applies due to displacement or concealment.$$Creatures other than the subject cannot see the [Phantom Foe], although they can attempt to guess its location by how the target acts.

The new form may be of the same type as the subject or any of the following types: aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin. The assumed form can't have more HD than your caster level (or the subject's HD, whichever is lower), to a maximum of 15 HD at 15th level. You can't cause a subject to assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you cause a subject to assume an incorporeal or [Gaseous Form]. The subject's creature type and subtype (if any) change to match the new form (see the {Monster Manual} for more information).$$Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if it had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal the subject further). If slain, the subject reverts to its original form, though it remains dead.$$The subject gains the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also gains all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as [Constrict], [Improved Grab], and [Poison]) but does not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form (such as [Blindsense], [Fast Healing], [Regeneration], and [Scent]) or any supernatural or spell-like abilities.$$Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action.$${{Material Component:}} An empty cocoon.

The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The DM determines the duration by using the following guidelines.#{{Changed Subject}};{{Increase to Duration Factor}}¹:Same kingdom (animal, vegetable, mineral);+5:Same class (mammals, fungi, metals, etc.);+2:Same size;+2:Related (twig is to tree, wolf fur is to wolf, etc.);+2:Same or lower Intelligence;+2#¹ Add all that apply.

If the original form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.$$Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and then grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed. Perhaps you could use a [Gust of Wind] spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force, although the DM must adjudicate many of these situations.$$A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren't affected by this spell. This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.$$This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of [Baleful Polymorph], [Polymorph], [Flesh to Stone], [Stone to Flesh], [Transmute Metal to Wood], [Transmute Mud to Rock], or [Transmute Rock to Mud].$${{Arcane Material Component:}} Mercury, gum arabic, and smoke.

You decide at the time of casting whether the [Portal Alarm] will be mental or audible.*{{Mental Alarm.}} A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) as long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area and on the same plane. You notice a mental tremor that would awaken you from a normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration (it would not interfere with spellcasting). A [Silence] spell has no effect on a mental alarm.*{{Audible Alarm.}} An audible portal alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, buzzer, or other similar repeating sound that can be heard clearly up to 60 feet away, and it pierces closed doors and extends onto other planes. The ringing can be heard faintly up to 180 feet away and lasts for 1 round. Creatures within the area of a [Silence] spell cannot hear the ringing, and if the portal itself is within the area of a [Silence] spell, no alarm is sounded.$$Ethereal and astral creatures trigger a [Portal Alarm] if they pass through the portal. You can set a [Portal Alarm] with a password, determined at the time of the casting, and this password can be discerned with the [Analyze Portal] spell. Those speaking the password before passing through the portal do not set off the alarm.$${{Material Component:}} A tiny bell.

Once cast, a [Prestidigitation] spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A [Prestidigitation] can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of non-living material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. [Prestidigitation] can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a [Prestidigitation] spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a [Prestidigitation] lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.$$Characters typically use [Prestidigitation] spells to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with [1Prestidigitations] include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs.

In addition, any creature that hits you with a nonreach melee weapon is subject to a random prismatic effect.

Each time an effect is expended, that color disappears from the aura (reroll if it comes up again on the table). Thus a [Prismatic Aura] can affect a maximum of seven attackers before it disappears, and the spell ends. An attacker is entitled to any applicable saves, and spell resistance applies to this effect.

You see the target's memories like stories and know that you can rewrite them as a master bard rewrites the inferior works of his apprentices.}$$You can selectively destroy, alter, or implant memories in the subject creature as you see fit. Casting the spell gives you access to all of the subject's thoughts and memories, allowing you to implement as many of the following specific effects as you like.*{{Memory Erasure.}} Memories possessed by the subject can be erased, including knowledge of specific events, people, or places. You can erase up to one full week of memories from the subject's mind.*{{Memory Implant.}} You can create false memories in the subject's mind as you see fit. You can implant memories of being friends with a hated enemy, events that didn't really take place, or betrayals by people the subject regards as friends.*{{Negative Levels.}} You can bestow a number of negative levels equal to 1/2 the subject's character level (rounding down, minimum 1st level) or less. This effect represents erasure of class knowledge and training. These negative levels never become permanent level loss, but they cannot be removed by spells such as [Restoration], instead returning at a rate of one level per day.*{{Persona Rebuilding.}} By erasing the subject's previous personality and implanting a false set of memories, you can build a new persona for the creature, altering its alignment, beliefs, values, and personality traits. (Some class abilities might be affected by alignment changes.)*{{Programmed Trigger.}} You can program the subject to delay the onset of any of the above effects until a specific event takes place, such as the receipt of a coded message, capture by enemies, or arrival at some destination. Similarly, you could specify some or all of the alterations you create in a subject to be removed by a specific event.$$The nature of [Programmed Amnesia] is such that a subject given new memories (whether willing or not) might be given cause to suspect that those memories are false, based on how complete your programming is. For example, a paladin subject to a Persona Rebuilding effect that changes her alignment to neutral loses her paladin abilities. Unless you impart a specific believable memory of why she changed alignment, the character will perceive this unexplained gap in her memory and might take steps (such as seeking a magical cure for her "amnesia") that could negate the spell's effect (see below).$$Generally, your subject must be either willing to undergo the spell or restrained in some way so that it cannot leave or interfere with the casting. [Programmed Amnesia] cannot be dispelled, and so is normally permanent unless you care to specify events that will end the effect. Its effect can also be removed by a [Greater Restoration], [Miracle], or [Wish] spell.$${{Material Component:}} A set of small crystal lenses set in gold loops worth 500 gp.

You receive a +4 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the spell resistance of any creature whose crime affected you personally. A successful save in these circumstances results in the target taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and checks. In addition, she has a 25% chance to lose all her actions for the duration of the spell.$$Any target whose offense did not affect you personally gets her full spell resistance, and a successful Will save negates the effects of the [Pronouncement of Fate].

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.$$First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.$$Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a [Magic Jar] attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as [Dominate Person]). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the [Protection from Evil] effect. If the [Protection from Evil] effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.$$Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect.

These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.$$While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 [Hide] modifier. It has a [Spot] modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.$$When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well.$$A sample command: "Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures." The phrase "Surround me" directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous. A "peasant" that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger an eye's return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between themselves see everything that crosses the ring.$$Another sample command: "Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return." The phrase "Spread out" directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him.$$Other commands that might be useful include having the eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions.$$In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.$$If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.$$The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. [Dispel Magic] can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an Area Dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.$${{Material Component:}} A handful of crystal marbles.

The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.$$Each elemental (fire) creature within the area of a [Quench] spell takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6, no save allowed).$$Alternatively, you can target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame, such as a wand of [Fireball] or a flaming burst sword. The item loses all its fire-based magical abilities for 1d4 hours unless it succeeds on a Will save. (Artifacts are immune to this effect.)

This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level.

Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.$$A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.$${{Material Component:}} Diamonds worth a total of least 5,000 gp.

Floating now effortlessly, it bobs up and down, never sinking more than an inch.}$$The subject of this spell gains magical buoyancy and floats on the surface of the water for the duration of the spell, despite its weight or normal buoyancy. It cannot swim below the surface of the water. Creatures that must breathe water can still do so. If the subject is underwater at the time this spell is cast, it rises toward the surface at a speed of 150 feet. The magic of the spell prevents the subject from taking damage from the speed of the ascent.$$This spell is particularly effective at raising sunken ships from the deep. If you know the exact details of the shipwreck (its appearance, its name, the date of its creation, its history, and the circumstances of its sinking), the vertical distance between you and the subject is not a factor. When cast to raise a shipwreck, the spell brings up all surviving fragments of the ship, along with any loose objects that are in contact with the ship or enclosed inside it. The ship and its fragments remain on the surface of the ocean until the spell's duration ends, at which point the ship sinks again if it has not been repaired. (Multiple consecutive castings of the spell might be needed to keep the ship afloat long enough to be fully repaired.)

Your body shakes uncontrollably, as if eagerly anticipating the power behind those spells.}$$This spell functions like [Dispel Magic], except that your caster level for your dispel check is a maximum of +20 instead of +10, and (as with [Greater Dispel Magic]) you have a chance to dispel any effect that [Remove Curse] can remove, even if [Dispel Magic] can't dispel that effect. When casting a Targeted Dispel or Counterspell, you can choose to reave each spell you successfully dispel, stealing its power and effect for yourself. When making a Targeted Dispel, make a [Spellcraft] check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the target spell or each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target creature or object.$$Each spell you dispel with a Targeted Dispel can be reaved if you so desire, and the spell's effects are redirected to you, continuing as if cast on you by the original caster with no interruption to or extension of duration. Once you reave the spell, you identify it if you haven't done so already (see below). If the subject was the caster and the spell is dismissible, you can dismiss it as if you had cast it yourself. Likewise, if the subject was the caster and the spell requires concentration, you must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect as if you had cast it yourself.$$You can still attempt to reave a spell you didn't identify with your [Spellcraft] check, but doing so can be risky if you don't know the specifics of the spell's effect. For example, if you fail to identity an ongoing spell effect on an enemy character and choose to reave anyway, you might find yourself under the influence of the [Dominate Person] effect that character was suffering from. Any spell resistance you might have has no effect against harmful spells you might inadvertently reave, but you get the same chance to save against those spell effects as the original target.$$If you choose to reave a spell you have successfully counterspelled with [Reaving Dispel], you seize control of the spell after the enemy caster completes it, and you can redirect the spell to whatever targets or area you wish (including the original caster, if appropriate). Again, you must make a [Spellcraft] check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the spell you intend to reave, but you are free to choose to redirect a spell whose effect, range, and area you don't know. If the redirected spell's correct casting conditions aren't met (because you guess at an improper target or range, for example), the spell fails.$$[Reaving Dispel] can be used to cast an Area Dispel with the increased maximum caster level, but any magical effects so dispelled cannot be reaved.

Any creature that has spells prepared, spell slots available for casting without preparation, or innate spell-like abilities must succeed on a Will save or be halted by an invisible barrier that prevents passage. The DC of the Will save increases by a number equal to the spell level of the highest-level spell the creature has prepared or is capable of casting (so that a 10th-level sorcerer who hasn't yet depleted his 5th-level spell slots for the day adds 5 to the save DC).

Spellcasters and creatures that have spell-like abilities and that are already within the area you protect when you create the ward are not compelled to leave or restricted in their movement within it (and spells and spell-like abilities can pass through the barrier in either direction with no difficulty). However, if such creatures leave the area, they must succeed on saving throws as described above to return.$$Creatures attempting to use any teleportation spell or effect to enter the warded area make the normal saving throw.

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.$$Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.$$A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to the its remaining ability scores. The subject's level (or HD) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can't be reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.$$It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.$$For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table.

The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces ("planes"). Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope "disappear." In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.$$Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present on the Material Plane, but it's invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The [Rope Trick] spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.$${{Note:}} It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one.${{Material Component:}} Powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment.

Each round on your turn, creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves or suffer the effects of being in the wind, as well as the effects of suspended grit.*A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage, and creates a duststorm with fine grains of sand that reduces visibility, smothers unprotected flames, and even chokes protected flames.*A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships. Wind of this speed creates a sandstorm that badly reduces visibility and deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open.*Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder. Wind of this speed creates a flensing sandstorm that severely reduces visibility and deals 1d3 points of lethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open.*A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees.

Damage from boiling mud continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only 1d6 points of fire damage per round.$$The transmuted material cools after a period of 1 round per caster level. The number of dice of damage the mud deals is halved each round after this duration expires. The transmuted rock remains as mud even after it cools. It eventually dries into soil, as per [Transmute Rock to Mud].$${{Arcane Material Component:}} A pinch of a mixture of clay, sulfur, and water.

The cylinders of shadow (called "glooms") occupy space as Medium creatures (a 5-foot square), are 10 feet tall, and cannot leave the area of the spell.$$A creature fully engulfed by one or more of these glooms has concealment. This concealment applies to attacks made against or by creatures in these glooms.$$The glooms are under your limited control. While the spell is in effect, you can use a free action on your turn to direct a controlled gloom to attach itself to and envelop a particular target and follow it. The target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid being enveloped. Success indicates the gloom dissipates; failure means the target is surrounded by magical darkness. Once it is attached to a target, a gloom stays with that target until the spell's duration expires.$${{Origin:}} This spell was created centuries ago by a steel dragon who eschewed human contact and masqueraded as a cruel necromancer who dwelt in an isolated tower.

When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Thus, you could specify the illusion of yourself and another character playing chess for the duration of the spell, but you could not have the illusory chess players take a break, make dinner, and then resume their game. You could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. You could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.$$Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. A band of people standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, for instance.$$Direct observation may allow a |Will |save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

You must make a successful caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) to scry a specific location. The difficulty of this check depends on how familiar you are with that location and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that place. Furthermore, the difficulty to scry the desired locale increases if the location is extremely far removed, indoors or underground, or on another plane.

A [Shadow Hand] is an opaque gray color, 5 feet long, and 5 feet wide with its fingers outstretched. It can grant total concealment against a single opponent you designate, carry materials as [Tenser's Floating Disk], or point or gesture as a normal hand does.$$The hand has an AC of 18 (+6 natural, +2 deflection) and has half as many hit points as your full normal total. It can be damaged just as [Bigby's Interposing Hand] can be, and it makes all saving throws as if it were you.$$Changing the hand's task or target is a standard action, and it can move anywhere in range. If not given any commands, the hand follows you at your speed, maintaining the same distance from you. The spell ends if the hand moves out of the spell's range.$$If carrying items and commanded to do something else, the hand drops whatever it is holding to complete its task (you can order the hand to rid itself of items gently as a standard action). Unlike [Tenser's Floating Disk], it does not have to follow you at a fixed distance — you direct where the hand goes.

The average temperature increases by 30 degrees, or decreases by 30 degrees if the desert is actually a tundra (see {Cold Dangers and Heat Dangers}, DMG 302–303). Sandstorms (or snowstorms if in a tundra) blow through a [Shadow Landscape] desert on an hourly basis.*{{Forest.}} Forests augmented with a [Shadow Landscape] spell become frightening places where a canopy of rotting leaves blocks the sun and all the trees are strangely twisted. Spaces with light undergrowth have heavy undergrowth instead, and spaces covered with heavy undergrowth grasp at passersby as if an [Entangle] spell had been cast on them (save DC equal to the [Shadow Landscape]'s DC).*{{Hill.}} Even gentle hills become more treacherous under the effect of a [Shadow Landscape] spell. Light undergrowth becomes heavy undergrowth in hill terrain, and slopes seem steeper than their elevation would indicate. It takes 2 squares of movement to move uphill on a gradual slope, and 4 squares to move uphill on a steep slope. Cliffs have frequent overhangs and are made of crumbling rock, requiring a DC 25 [Climb] check to ascend or descend.*{{Marsh.}} Marshes seem swampier and more forbidding. Half the undergrowth spaces in the marsh become quicksand (DMG 88).*{{Mountain.}} The mountains become places of jagged peaks, slippery slopes, and howling winds. Cliffs and chasms require a DC 25 [Climb] check to scale. Creatures who fail [Climb] checks or make loud noises have a 10% chance of starting an avalanche (DMG 90). Altitude effects are one category worse: areas lower than 5,000 feet are treated as the 5,000- to 15,000-foot category, and anything above 5,000 feet is treated as being above 15,000 feet.*{{Plain.}} Only natural grasslands change as a result of [Shadow Landscape], but they become wide-open spaces with stands of thick bushes where thunderstorms and tornados are frequent. Half the spaces with undergrowth (light or heavy) grasp at passersby as if an [Entangle] spell had been cast on them (save DC equal to the [Shadow Landscape]'s DC).*{{Underground.}} Ordinary dungeons aren't affected by [Shadow Landscape], but naturally occurring caverns are. Natural stone floors take 4 squares of movement per space to enter. Stalagmites cover 10% of the available floor space.$$In addition to terrain-specific effects, a [Shadow Landscape] spell worsens the weather within the spell's area. When rolling random weather (DMG 94), roll twice and take the higher result. In plains terrain, roll three times and take the highest result. This effect does not apply underground.$$You don't suffer the terrain-specific effects (entangling terrain, hindrances to movement, altitude effects, higher [Climb] DCs, and so on) of a [Shadow Landscape] you created. When you cast [Shadow Landscape], you can designate one creature per four caster levels as a designated traveler. Creatures so designated don't suffer the terrain-specific effects of the spell, but they're still subject to the bad weather.$$You can also designate one or more animals, plants, or magical beasts native to the spell's area as shadow guardians of the landscape. You can designate 1 HD of creatures per caster level, split up however you like. For example, a 20th-level druid could designate two treants (7 HD each) and a dire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians. As long as the designated guardians remain within the spell's area, they have a friendly attitude toward you and the travelers you have designated, and they also gain the following special qualities: resistance to cold 10, [Darkvision] out to 60 feet, damage reduction 5/magic, [Evasion], and [Low-Light Vision]. If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value.

You also gain a 50% chance each round to avoid having to make a saving throw against gaze attacks, just as if you averted your eyes. If you avert your eyes while using [Shadow Mask], you get to check twice to see if you avoid having to make the saving throw.$$When the spell's duration ends, the [Shadow Mask] fades over the course of 1d4 rounds (rather than immediately), giving you time to keep your face hidden by other means. A successful [Dispel Magic] cast against a [Shadow Mask] effectively ends the spell and causes the same slow fading.$${{Material Component:}} A mask of black cloth.

Viewers that fail their saving throws see a burst of bright light on the first round and become blinded for 1 round. On subsequent rounds for the rest of the spell's duration, the affected creatures continue to perceive a bright light. If they take penalties in bright illumination, they take them for the duration of their exposure to this light. Additionally, they are dazzled while in the area of the spell.

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.$$In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.$$Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 = 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 = 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).$$[Shadow Walk] can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.$$Any creatures touched by you when [Shadow Walk] is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

The target must make a Will save or be pulled into the gateway. Inside the pocket realm, the creature sees a deserted, gloomy duplicate of the real world, while shadowy phantasms stalk and taunt it without causing actual harm. Each round, the creature can attempt another Will save to return from the [Shadow Well]. Otherwise, the subject returns to the real world when the spell's duration expires.$$Being trapped in a [Shadow Well] can be terrifying; upon returning to the real world, the subject must succeed on another Will save or be frightened for 1d4 rounds.$$Upon leaving the pocket realm, the subject reappears in the spot it had been in when the [Shadow Well] spell was cast. If this spot is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest adjacent empty space.$$Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as [Teleport] and [Dimension Door], do not help a creature escape a [Shadow Well] spell, although a [Plane Shift] spell allows it to flee to another plane as normal. The target might still become frightened upon leaving.

Those who have heard it compare it to the song of a siren.$$A target who fails a saving throw against this spell moves immediately toward the nearest stretch of ocean that it can find and attempts to completely submerse itself in the water. This flight will be by the safest means possible, withdrawing from combat, fighting defensively, and not passing through threatened areas.$$The target will only fight if someone actively attempts to prevent it from following through with its search for the ocean; if this fight is with an ally, the target is granted a second saving throw to throw off the effects of the spell.$$In some environments, this means that those affected simply flee in the direction of the nearest coast. Along a shoreline, targets often plunge into the surf. Aboard ship, they leap overboard. If the subject has no idea where to find a substantial body of water, it simply chooses a random direction and continues until the spell expires.$$Once the spell's subjects are in the water, they begin swimming toward the deepest part of it they can reach, immersing themselves completely and refusing to come up for air, though they hold their breath as long as they are able.

Casting this spell successfully requires smoke from a natural fire large enough to fill a 5-foot square, such as a normal campfire, bonfire, or any significant amount of burning debris (torch flames or creatures made of fire or smoke do not suffice).$$After casting this spell, you can move into the column of smoke produced by such fires and can ascend vertically into a square filled with smoke. To your eyes the smoke coalesces into ghostly steps, though other observers see nothing different. When stepping into the column you are considered to be in the smoke above the flame and take no damage from the fire. Every 5 feet of upward movement costs 2 squares of movement. For example, an assassin with a speed of 30 feet casts [Smoke Stairs] on himself, then moves 10 feet across the ground to a smoking fire and ascends 10 feet vertically in a single move action.$$If anything dissipates the column of smoke while you are moving though it using this spell, you lose your footing and fall.

Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot-square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM's option). Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected.$$A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge.$$Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface.$$Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example, a party of adventurers trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall. While [Soften Earth and Stone] does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.$$A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure (such as a wall or a tower) by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.

If the spell maintained by the [Sonorous Hum] has a shorter duration than that of this spell, the maintained spell expires as it normally would, and you gain no further benefits from this casting of [Sonorous Hum]. The sound created by the spell is as loud as a person in armor walking at a slow pace trying not to make noise (normally a DC 5 [Listen] check to detect). You can end the spell as a free action.$$For example, you could cast this spell, then cast [Detect Thoughts], and this spell maintains the concentration on [Detect Thoughts] while you cast [Discern Lies] and maintain concentration on that spell yourself.

For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the [Spectral Hand]. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if the hand goes beyond the spell range, goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and hovers.$$The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has [Improved Evasion] (half damage on a failed Reflex save and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of at least 22. Your Intelligence modifier applies to the hand's AC as if it were the hand's Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it.

For the duration of this spell, any touch spells you cast are discharged only if you cast another spell with that forelimb or touch something with that forelimb.$$For example, a human sorcerer casts this spell, then casts [Chill Touch] and holds the charge in his left hand, then casts [Shocking Grasp] and holds the charge in his right hand. Because of the [Spell Flower], he can hold the charge on both of these spells at the same time. If he casts another spell with a somatic component (which requires the use of one of his hands), he immediately loses one of his held touch spells (his choice), but if the spell he casts is also a touch spell, he can immediately hold the charge in the available hand. If he chooses to attack with a touch spell, it works normally. Since he has multiple limbs that are considered armed, he can make an off-hand attack with the other touch spell in the same round, with the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons (PH 160).$$A marilith spellcaster could do the same as the sorcerer in the previous example, except that she could hold the charge on up to six touch spells.

Upon casting this spell, you instantly discern all spells currently affecting the target (including their effects). For each spell so discerned, you can make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the spell's caster level. If the check succeeds, you gain the effect of the spell for the remainder of its duration, as if it had been cast on you instead of the original target, and the opponent loses that effect.$$Only spells capable of being dispelled can be affected by [Spell Theft]. In addition, if you are not a legal target of the spell to be stolen, your dispel check automatically fails.

The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. [Spell Turning] also fails to stop touch range spells. Thus, a [Charm Person] spell cast at you could be turned back upon the caster and possibly enable you to use the charm effect on that individual, but a [Fireball] could not be turned back, and neither could [Inflict Critical Wounds].$$From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The DM secretly rolls the exact number. When a spell is turned, the DM subtracts its level from the amount of [Spell Turning] left.$$When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of [Spell Turning] you have left, that spell is partially turned. The DM subtracts the amount of [Spell Turning] left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divides the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected.$$For example, if you had three levels of [Spell Turning] left and were targeted by a [Magic Missile] spell heightened to 4th level, you would turn three-fourths of the spell back at the caster. You would take one-fourth of the damage, while the caster takes three-fourths of the damage. If you were targeted by a wizard's [Fear] spell (also a 4th-level spell) in the same situation, you would have a one in four (25%) chance to be affected by the spell, while the caster would have a three in four (75%) chance to be affected.$$If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by [Spell Turning] effects in operation, a resonating field is created.

Unlike with [Polymorph], this spell allows the subjects to gain a spider's poisonous bite. All the creatures you transmute must become spiders of the same size.$$Subjects remain in the spider form until the spell expires or you dismiss the spell for all subjects. In addition, an individual subject can choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action. Doing so ends the spell for that creature only.

It can only take a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor can it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.$$In addition, any attack by the creature that would normally include poison (such as a spider's bite) does not do so, but all other effects associated with that attack apply. For example, if an aranea subject to [Spiderbind] cast a touch spell and then bit a creature, the attack would deal normal bite damage and trigger the touch spell, but the bite would not inject poison.$$While you have this spell prepared, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against poison. Clerics of Eilistraee created this spell to help battle the many spiderlike creatures that serve Lolth. Araneas, bebiliths, chitines, choldriths, driders, ettercaps, myrlochars, phase spiders, retrievers, and yochlols are sufficiently spiderlike to be affected by this spell.

A set of ghostly dinosaur jaws comes into being and attacks the creature you designate.}$$This spell creates a set of powerful jaws of force. The jaws attempt to grapple the designated opponent, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. The jaws use your base attack bonus (possibly allowing them multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) + your Wisdom modifier as their attack bonus. If an initial attack hits, the jaws deal 2d6 points of damage and attempt to start a grapple as a free action. The jaws bonus on grapple checks is equal to their attack bonus + 4.$$Once the opponent is grappled, the jaws deal 2d6 points of damage with each subsequent grapple check. The target is considered to be grappling and cannot move; it no longer threatens squares and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC against opponents not grappling it.$$The jaws always strike from your direction. They do not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. Your feats do not affect the jaws. If the jaws move beyond the range of the spell, they vanish. As a magical force effect, the jaws cannot be damaged, but [Disintegrate] or a sphere of annihilation destroys the effect.$$The grappled target can cast a spell only if it has no somatic component, the material components are in hand, and a [Concentration] check (DC 20 + spell level) is made. A creature grappled by the jaws can attempt to escape by succeeding on a grapple check against the jaws or by making a successful [Escape Artist] check as a standard action opposed by the jaws' grapple check.$$As a free action, you can direct the jaws to pin a grappled opponent instead of dealing damage with a grapple check. If the jaws win the opposed grapple check, the opponent is pinned. A pinned opponent is immobile and must break the pin before it can escape the grapple. Creatures other than those grappling the pinned target gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls to hit it. If the jaws have multiple attacks, you can use them to damage a pinned target or to make more grapple attempts against it.$$Each round after the first, you can use a move action to direct the jaws to a new target. If you do not, the jaws continue to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the jaws switch targets, they get one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the jaws to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it. If you become unable to command the jaws, they vanish.$${{Material Component:}} A piece of bone from a dinosaur's jaw.

As though leaping down from an invisible charger, a translucent knight, clad head to toe in heavy plate, appears by your side. The holy symbol of your deity is emblazoned across his tabard and shield.}$$By casting this spell, you create a translucent knight made of force. It remains within 5 feet of you at all times, constantly matching your speed and mode of travel — even if you are mounted or magically accelerated. Any time you are attacked, it moves to parry the attack with its shield or longsword, granting you a +6 deflection bonus to AC. As a standard action in any round, you can command the knight to make a single attack against any creature within 5 feet. It strikes with its longsword, using your base attack bonus and applying your Wisdom modifier to the roll. The attack deals 1d8 points of force damage +1 extra point per three caster levels (maximum +10).$$At any point before the spell expires, you can turn the knight loose and order it to fight on its own. It then moves at a speed of 60 feet to attack any foe you designate. It continues to use your base attack bonus and your Wisdom modifier for its attack rolls, and it can make as many attacks per round as your base attack bonus allows. You need not concentrate on the knight as long as it is fighting a specific opponent, but commanding it to change foes requires a move action. If its opponent falls, the knight waits for your direction.$$Once you have turned the knight loose, you lose the deflection bonus to AC that it provided, and you cannot regain it. Furthermore, the remaining duration of the spell converts from minutes per level to rounds per level on a one-to-one basis.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as [Weapon Focus]) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you have not designated an opponent, the weapon returns to you and hovers.$$Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the [Spiritual Weapon] is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.$$A [Spiritual Weapon] cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but [Dispel Magic], [Disintegrate], a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A [Spiritual Weapon]'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).$$If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the [Spiritual Weapon] strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.$$The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon, many of which have individual names. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a [Spiritual Weapon] of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time.

It becomes impossible for you to fall or be thrown off your mount. Prying you from the saddle requires a DC 20 Strength check, and you gain a +10 bonus on [Ride] checks related to staying in the saddle. The spell must be cast after you are seated on your mount. If you are not seated on your mount when the spell is cast, the spell fails. If the spell is cast while you are riding bareback, you are "stuck" to the mount's back. Otherwise, you are merely stuck to the saddle, but the saddle is attached to the mount normally. If you are knocked unconscious while this spell is in effect, you automatically remain in the saddle. The spell can be dismissed as an immediate action, and it does not impede the rider from making a soft fall if the mount is dropped in battle.

When this ray successfully strikes, it creates a sensation of many tiny insects biting and crawling on the victim's body. The target can attempt a Will save each round to shake off the effect. Until the spell is shrugged off, the victim is hampered by the unsettling feeling of all the stinging and biting, and is able to perform only a single move or standard action each round. The victim also takes a –2 penalty to AC.$$In addition, if the victim attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a [Concentration] check with a DC equal to the [Sting Ray]'s DC + the level of the spell the subject is attempting to cast. For example, if a 6th-level sorcerer with a Charisma score of 16 casts [Sting Ray] on a wizard casting a [Fireball], the [Concentration] check DC is 19 (16, [Sting Ray] DC, + 3, [Fireball] spell level).$$A successful Will save negates the effect restricting the subject's action to one move or one standard action each round, nor does the subject need to make a [Concentration] check each time it wishes to cast a spell. However, the subject still takes the penalty to AC for the duration of the spell with a successful save.$${{Material Component:}} Four dried stinging insects (bees, wasps, and so on).

You can choose whether the bolt is cast all at once or partially stored in a 5-foot-square metal or stone surface within range. When casting, in addition to selecting the path of the bolt, you decide how many dice to allocate to the initial lightning strike, how many to send into the storage surface, and how long (to a maximum of 5 rounds) before the stored lightning discharges. If all damage is allocated to the initial strike, no energy is stored; if all damage is allocated to be stored, the bolt appears to miss any targets in its path and strike the stone or metal surface harmlessly.$$The initial strike does damage to all creatures within its area, as a [Lightning Bolt] spell. When released, the stored bolt deals damage to all creatures within a 60-foot-radius spread centered on the point where the bolt struck. The bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects, just as a normal [Lightning Bolt]. If the storage surface is an unbroken wall, damage extends in a semicircle from the wall. However, the blast passes or burns through doorways and other portals into areas on the other side of a wall, and wraps around free-standing surfaces such as columns.$$If the surface is touched by any creature before the delay time is up, the stored bolt is discharged automatically, with the touching creature taking double the stored damage and all other creatures in the blast area taking half damage.$$All victims of both the initial and the stored strikes take half damage on a successful Reflex save.

Immediately, a razor-sharp stalagmite bursts from the ground to impale your foe.}$$This spell creates a stalagmite about 1 foot wide at its base and up to 10 feet tall. If it encounters a ceiling before it reaches full size, it stops growing. The stalagmite grows from the ground under the target creature and shoots upward. An airborne creature within 10 feet of the ground gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw, and airborne creatures more than 10 feet above the ground cannot be harmed by this spell.$$The stalagmite deals 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). In addition, a target that fails to make a saving throw against this spell and takes damage from it is impaled on the stalagmite and cannot move from its current location until it makes a DC 15 [Escape Artist] check. The stalagmite can be removed in other ways as well, such as with a [Stone Shape] spell. The victim can break free with a DC 25 Strength check, although doing this deals it 3d6 points of slashing damage.$$A creature's damage reduction, if any, applies to the damage from this spell. The damage from [Sudden Stalagmite] is treated as piercing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

The [Suggestion] must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.

However, a [Suggestion] that a pool of acid is actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking your party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power.$$The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a noble knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.$$A very reasonable [Suggestion] causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as –1 or –2) at the discretion of the DM.$${{Material Component:}} A snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.

Instead of dealing damage, a [Sword of Darkness] bestows one negative level on each successful hit against a living creature, threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19–20, and bestows two negative levels on a critical hit.

The blade immediately attacks your enemy.}$$You cause a blade of pale green force to appear and strike the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. Though it makes regular melee attacks, the sword strikes as a spell, not a weapon (and so can strike incorporeal creatures). A [Sword of Deception] always strikes from your direction, and so it can't be used to flank with your attacks, but it could flank with your allies.$$The blade attacks with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level, dealing 1d8 points of damage per hit and threatening a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. In addition, each successful hit provides a –2 penalty on the target's next saving throw roll (–4 on a successful critical hit). This penalty is cumulative (to a maximum of –5 on a single creature) and lasts until the creature is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation or receives the benefit of a [Remove Curse] spell.$$Each round, a [Sword of Deception] continues to attack the previous round's target unless you use a standard action to switch it to a new target within range. In any round when the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack as a standard action (as it does in the round when the spell is cast). The weapon can make multiple attack rolls against a single target with a full attack action if its base attack bonus permits. A [Sword of Deception] cannot be attacked or damaged (though it can be dispelled as any other spell).$$If an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster level check the first time the sword attacks. If the check is successful, the sword can attack that creature with normal effect for the duration of the spell. If not, the [Sword of Deception] is dispelled.

Symbol of Death@0000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000001100010010000000000010000010001100000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000010000000000000101100000000000000000010000000000000000000001000000@Necromancy [Death];Cleric 8, Sorcerer 8, Wizard 8;Dread Necromancer 8;;;Rune 8;Verbal, Somatic, Gold;10 minutes;0 foot;;;;Permanent (trigger);Fortitude negates;Yes;PHB p289@This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a [Symbol of Death] slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The [Symbol of Death] affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the [Symbol of Death] is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.$$Until it is triggered, the [Symbol of Death] is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a [Symbol of Death] must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the [Symbol of Death] ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the [Symbol of Death] works normally.$$As a default, a [Symbol of Death] is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a [Symbol of Death] can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a [Symbol of Death]'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.$$In this case, "reading" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a [Symbol of Death] to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a [Symbol of Death] offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered [Symbol of Death] remains untriggered if an item bearing the [Symbol of Death] is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a [Symbol of Death] cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.$$You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a [Symbol of Death] can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify. For example, a [Symbol of Death] can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.$$When scribing a [Symbol of Death], you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.$$You also can attune any number of creatures to the [Symbol of Death], but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit. Any creature attuned to a [Symbol of Death] cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own [1Symbols of Death], and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.$$[Read Magic] allows you to identify a [Symbol of Death] with a DC 19 [Spellcraft] check. Of course, if the [Symbol of Death] is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.$$A [Symbol of Death] can be removed by a successful [Dispel Magic] targeted solely on the rune. An [Erase] spell has no effect on a [Symbol of Death]. Destruction of the surface where a [Symbol of Death] is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.$$[Symbol of Death] can be made permanent with a [Permanency] spell. A permanent [Symbol of Death] that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.$${{Note:}} Magic traps such as [Symbol of Death] are hard to detect and disable.

Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.*{{Sustained Force.}} A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.^This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.^An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM.*{{Combat Maneuver.}} Alternatively, once per round, you can use [Telekinesis] to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.*{{Violent Thrust.}} Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).^You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder).^Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).

Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.$$You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. You can't simply [Teleport] to the warlord's tent if you don't know where that tent is, what it looks like, or what's in it. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.$$To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the [Teleport] table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.*{{Familiarity.}} "Very familiar" is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as [Scrying]) to study the place for at least one hour. "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.^"False destination" is a place that does not truly exist, such as if you scryed on an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed a [False Vision], or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you (for instance, a home that has burned to the ground). When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.*{{On Target.}} You appear where you want to be.*{{Off Target.}} You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10×1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be 15% off target. That's 18 miles, in this case. The DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, and so forth. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.*{{Similar Area.}} You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. A wizard heading for her home laboratory might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemy supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If the DM determines no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.*{{Mishap.}} You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten "scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.#{{Familiarity}};{{On target}};{{Off Target}};{{Similar Area}};{{Mishap}}:Very familiar;01–97;98–99;100;—:Studied carefully;01–94;95–97;98–99;100:Seen casually;01–88;89–94;95–98;99–100:Viewed once;01–76;77–88;89–96;97–100:False destination (1d20+80);—;—;81–92;93–100#

As well as dealing lethal damage with your unarmed strikes (if you don't already do so), you deal an extra 1d6 points of piercing damage (so that a human under the effect of [Thornskin] would deal 1d3 points of bludgeoning damage + 1d6 points of piercing damage with an unarmed strike). In addition, any creature that hits you with a natural weapon or unarmed strike (including all successful grapple checks) takes 5 points of piercing damage.$$A creature's damage reduction, if any, applies to the damage from this spell. The damage from [Thornskin] is treated as piercing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.$${{Material Component:}} A thorn.

Once they become solid, the three weapons shoot forward at your targets.}$$This spell allows you to split a target weapon of up to Large size (such as a greatsword, shortspear, and so on) into three exact duplicates. These duplicates immediately launch themselves at a target or targets of your choice within close range. You can direct one or more of the weapons at the same target or split them up among three different targets. Make a ranged attack roll for each weapon (using your ranged attack bonus or the ranged attack bonus of a fighter of your caster level, whichever is higher) as if you were proficient with the weapon in the normal manner. (For example, if used on a greatsword, you would make a ranged attack roll as if you were proficient with the greatsword, without the normal penalty for using an improvised throwing weapon.) The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if it does not have an enhancement bonus already.$$Each duplicate that hits deals damage as if you had struck the target with the weapon in melee (including any special effects such as [Bane], [Smite Evil], critical hits, sneak attack, [Weapon Focus], and so on). Your Strength bonus does not apply, since the force of the weapon comes from the spell, not your own Strength. A duplicate does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.$$Casting the spell destroys the targeted weapon to create the duplicates, and the duplicates are destroyed whether or not they hit. Because of this, the spell is rarely used on magic weapons. It cannot be cast on artifacts, natural weapons, weapons animated with [Animate Objects] or similar spells, or weaponlike magical creations (such as [Mordenkainen's Sword]).$${{Origin:}} This spell was created by Delgarth of Sumbarin, a long-forgotten minor realm along the banks of the River Dessarin. Delgarth was a powerful barbarian who concealed his limited prowess as a sorcerer so he could use it as an unexpected advantage during the frequent assassination attempts launched by his estranged kinfolk.

The water has an effective Strength of 16 and is considered Medium size (or Strength 20 and Large if cast near a source of water). You designate the direction the wave pushes when you cast the spell; creatures who lose the opposed Strength check are pushed back 5 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 points by which the wave beats their Strength checks, in that direction. It is possible for a wave arising from a body of water to push characters into the water.$$The wave puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames if they are carried by the target or located within the area and they are Large size or smaller.

This spell imbues the caster with an ability to heal minor wounds that lasts throughout the day.$$When you cast this spell, you store healing energy within your own form that can then be used to heal a number of hit points equal to twice your caster level (maximum 10 hit points). You may choose to divide this healing among multiple recipients, and you don't have to use it all at once. Delivering healing with this spell requires a touch (a standard action) but does not provoke attacks of opportunity.$$The effects of multiple [Touch of Jorasco] spells do not stack, meaning that you can only store healing energy from one such spell at a time. If you cast the spell again before discharging all of the healing from a previous casting, the new total simply replaces the earlier one, effectively ending the previous spell.$$As with all healing spells, [Touch of Jorasco] deals damage to undead creatures. Using the spell in this way requires a successful melee touch attack but doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. You decide how many points of healing energy to discharge as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.

For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud. Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.$$Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since [Transmute Rock to Mud] can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.

The creature can also make a Strength check to break free. The break DC is 20, +2 per inch of thickness of the stone.

If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into a heap of sand. Magical stone is not affected by this spell. The depth of the sand created cannot exceed 10 feet.$$If [Transmute Stone to Sand] is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the sand falls to the floor and scatters in a pile 5 feet deep. For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into sand. Piling on the floor, this sand would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet. The falling sand and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.$$Castles and large stone buildings generally have immunity to this spell, since [Transmute Stone to Sand] can’t affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such buildings’ foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.$$The sand remains until a successful [Dispel Magic] or [Transmute Sand to Stone] spell restores its substance — though not necessarily its form.$${{Arcane Material Component:}} Sandstone and granite.

If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.$$Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.*{{Spell Completion.}} First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.*{{Trigger Object.}} The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A [Sympathy] spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.$${{Material Component:}} Before the actual casting of [Trap the Soul], you must procure a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every HD possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 HD creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or HD as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more HD.)${{Focus (Trigger Object only):}} If the trigger object method is used, a special trigger object, prepared as described above, is needed.

It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so, thus allowing you to command it to clean the floor and then turn your attention elsewhere as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.$$The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.)

A stuck creature can speak but is otherwise limited to purely mental actions (such as casting spells with no somatic or material components) and attempts to free itself by means of a Strength check or [Escape Artist] check (against a DC equal to this spell's DC) made as a full-round action. A Large or larger creature stuck in the goo can't move from the spot where it is glued, but it can otherwise act normally.$$The glob dissipates when the spell duration expires. Until then, it remains sticky, and any creature touching it (for example, a creature attempting to pull out an ally) must make a successful Reflex save or become stuck itself. A creature stuck by such secondary contact is not trapped as thoroughly as a creature targeted by the glob, however, so the DC of the Strength check or [Escape Artist] check required to get free is reduced by 5.$${{Material Component:}} A tiny ball of spider silk.

A [Wall of Ice] cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire, including a [Fireball] spell and red dragon breath, can melt a [Wall of Ice], and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a [Wall of Ice] creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.*{{Ice Plane.}} A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a [Wall of Ice] 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.^The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.^Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).*{{Hemisphere.}} The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.$${{Material Component:}} A small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal.

This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.$$A [Wall of Iron] is 1 inch thick per four caster levels| and its area is up to one 5-foot square per caster level|.

A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.$$If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves.

It merges into adjoining rock surfaces, melting the rock at the point of connection to form a smooth bond. The wall can seal off a passage or breach, but the intense heat causes flammable materials in contact with the [Wall of Magma] to catch fire instantly. A [Wall of Magma] is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.$$You can shape a [Wall of Magma] into sheets and curves, but the molten wall cannot form domes or unsupported horizontal surfaces more than 5 feet across. The wall need not be vertical but must rest upon a firm foundation; it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. The wall cannot hold complex forms such as crenellations. It is possible (though difficult) to form the wall into a ring to enclose creatures, but they can avoid this with successful Reflex saves.$$The wall sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d6 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. Unlike a [Wall of Fire], both sides of a [Wall of Magma] radiate heat. Since it is molten, the wall cannot be broken as such, but an object or creature could force its way through. It costs 4 squares of movement to move through a square containing a [Wall of Magma], but creatures of the earth subtype can pass through the wall at normal speed. A [Wall of Magma] deals 5d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to creatures passing through it, the same amount each round to any creature within it, and 2d6 points of fire damage per round for 1d3 rounds after a creature leaves the area of the wall. It deals double damage to undead and creatures with the water subtype.$$The wall can be destroyed normally by a [Disintegrate] spell. If any 5-foot section of the wall takes 40 points of cold damage or more in a round, that section hardens into normal stone (hardness 8, 15 hit points per inch of thickness), which can then be chipped or broken as normal (DC 20 Strength check, +2 per inch of thickness). Do not divide cold damage by four, as normal for objects. Casting [Create Water] on the surface of a [Wall of Magma] creates a cloud of steamy fog that fills a cube with the dimensions of the length of wall affected. The fog dissipates after 10 minutes. Only the surface of the stone hardens; the wall is not cooled completely.$$[Wall of Magma] can be made permanent with a [Permanency] spell. A permanent [Wall of Magma] that is chilled by cold damage stays solid for 10 minutes, then returns to its molten state.$${{Arcane Material Component:}} A small piece of pumice, obsidian, or other volcanic rock.

The wall need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm or as a ramp.

This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.$$Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). For example, a creature that rolled 25 on its Strength check could move 5 feet in a round. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.$$Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a [Wall of Thorns] at normal speed without taking damage.$$A [Wall of Thorns] can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.$$Despite its appearance, a [Wall of Thorns] is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.

It provides concealment in both directions, imposing a 20% miss chance on any attacks passing through it. You cannot conjure the wall so that it occupies the same space as a creature.$$Any living creature passing through the wall is subjected to hundreds of tiny bites. It takes 2d6 points of damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. Any creature becoming nauseated while moving through the wall can complete its move action, but cannot take a standard action in that round.$$The [Wall of Vermin] is immune to weapon damage, though it can be affected by area spells and effects (such as [Burning Hands] or [Cone of Cold]). It has 20 hit points and automatically fails any save. [Disintegrate] has no effect on a [Wall of Vermin], since it is not a single physical object, though any wind of 50 mph or greater breaks it up for 1 round. Despite its appearance, a [Wall of Vermin] is not made up of natural creatures, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect animals or vermin.

The water of the wall is calm as a lake on a windless day.}$$This spell creates a 10-foot-thick wall of fresh water or seawater (as selected by you). The water forms around objects and creatures in its area, plunging these creatures and objects underwater. A creature in the area where the water is created can make a Reflex save to move to a random side of the wall before it forms completely. This movement must occur on the creature's next turn, or it immediately suffers the full effect of being in the wall.$$Creatures can move through a [Wall of Water] by making [Swim] checks, or can walk along the floor at half speed; the water itself is considered to be calm water. Any open flames in the area when the water forms are immediately extinguished. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level each round they remain partially or wholly in the wall.$$Although the wall is transparent, it provides cover to any targets inside against attacks launched from outside the wall. It cannot be destroyed by physical damage, nor can it be drained off to a different location.

After casting this spell, the next spell you cast upon the target wand affects the remaining charges, allowing the wand to discharge that spell instead of the one it was created to cast.$$The spell cast after [Wand Modulation] must be of a lower level than the spell the wand normally casts. Replacement spells cast from the affected wand are cast at the minimum caster level. Each use of an affected wand now expends 2 charges from the wand instead of the usual single charge. If the wand holds insufficient charges to invoke the new spell, it cannot be activated. You can't use [Wand Modulation] to change a wand's spell to one with a costly material component or focus or with an XP component, even if the original spell has a similar component or focus.$$For example, a 5th-level wizard facing an angry fire elemental wishes to cast [Magic Missile] (a 1st-level spell) from his wand of [Scorching Ray] (a 2nd-level spell), which happens to have a caster level of 5th. He casts [Wand Modulation] and in the following round casts [Magic Missile]. The wand can now cast [Magic Missile] as a 1st-level caster (the minimum caster level), but each use expends 2 charges. The wizard can now use the wand to cast [Magic Missile] for 5 minutes, after which it reverts back to a normal wand of [Scorching Ray].

Trapped creatures remain inside for 1d3 rounds before the [Waterspout] ejects them out the top of the spout, and they fall back to the surface (taking 8d6 points of falling damage) 1d8×5 feet from the base of the [Waterspout].$$Waterborne creatures or objects within 10 feet of the spout (below and on all sides) also must make successful Reflex saves or be sucked into the spout if they are Medium or smaller. Anything sucked into the spout takes 3d8 points of damage and is then trapped for 1d3 rounds as described above.$$Only the smallest of watercraft, such as canoes, kayaks, or coracles, can be sucked into the spout. The occupant of any such craft can make a [Profession] (sailor) check instead of a Reflex save if it so chooses to avoid being sucked up.

If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 [Escape Artist] check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or [Escape Artist] check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the [Web] very slowly.

You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.$$Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.$$A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.$$For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even [Wish], however, has its limits. A [Wish] can produce any one of the following effects.*Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.*Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.*Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.*Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.*Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as [Geas/Quest] or [1Insanity].*Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.*Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.*Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five [Wish] spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two [1Wishes] for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.*Remove injuries and afflictions. A single [Wish] can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same [Wish]. A [Wish] can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.*Revive the dead. A [Wish] can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a [Resurrection] spell. A [Wish] can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two [1Wishes], one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A [Wish] cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.*Transport travelers. A [Wish] can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.*Undo misfortune. A [Wish] can undo a single recent event. The [Wish] forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a [Wish] could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.$$You may try to use a [Wish] to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a [Wish] gives the DM the opportunity to fulfill your request without fulfilling it completely. (The [Wish] may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.) For example, wishing for a staff of the magi might get you instantly transported to the presence of the staff's current owner. Wishing to be immortal could get you imprisoned in a hidden extradimensional space (as by an [Imprisonment] spell), where you could "live" indefinitely.$$Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).$${{Material Component:}} When a [Wish] duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.${{XP Cost:}} The minimum XP cost for casting [Wish] is 5,000. When a [Wish] duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a [Wish] creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.

The subject's subsequent melee attacks gain a +4 bonus and deal double damage. Once the spell is active, the subject must attack foes of opposite alignment every round if able to do so, or the spell effect ends. The subject knows which creatures within 60 feet are of opposite alignment.$$If you create a [Zealot Pact] with a neutral deity (such as Obad-Hai), choose one alignment from among the following that triggers the [Zealot Pact]: lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic evil, or chaotic good.$$A creature can be subject to only one [Zealot Pact] at a time. Casting [Zealot Pact] on a subject that already has an untriggered [Zealot Pact] voids the earlier pact.$${{XP Cost:}} 500.

Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.
