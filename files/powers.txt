You can adapt to underwater, extremely hot, extremely cold, or airless environments, allowing you to survive as if you were a creature native to that environment. You can breathe and move (though penalties to movement and attacks, if any for a particular environment, remain), and you take no damage simply from being in that environment. You need not specify what environment you are adapting to when you manifest this power; simply activate it, and your body will instantly adapt to any hostile environment as needed throughout the duration.$$You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such as acid, lava, fire, and electricity. Any environmental feature that normally directly deals 1 or more dice of damage per round (such as lava, which deals 20d6 points of damage per round of immersion) deals you only half the usual amount of damage.$$An attack form is not treated as an environment. For example, even if you're adapted to extremely cold conditions, you are still vulnerable to psionic or magical attacks that deal cold damage.

While the duration lasts, affected creatures take all damage (including ability damage) as you do and heal all wounds as you do. For instance, if you take 10 points of damage from a sword wound, all creatures within the area also take 10 points of damage. On the other hand, if you are subject to healing psionics or magic, all creatures in the [Affinity Field] are also healed. Hit points gained or lost persist after this power ends.$$Creatures in range are also subject to magical and psionic effects of 3rd level or lower (you therefore couldn't grant all nearby subjects the effects of [Greater Metamorphosis] when you manifest it on yourself, for instance). Creatures that have an affinity to you gain a saving throw against each new power transferred through the [Affinity Field] as if the power were manifested upon them normally. All magical and psionic effects transferred to subjects fade at the end of this power's duration, although instantaneous effects remain, such as the effects of curing power. If you suddenly become immune to a particular effect or power, such as might be the case if you manifested [Iron Body] on yourself, the effect or power to which you are immune cannot be transferred to creatures that have affinity to you.$$For example, if you manifest [Animal Affinity] to gain an enhancement to your Strength score, so too do all creatures in range. However, even though [Animal Affinity] lasts much longer, when [Affinity Field] ends, all affected creatures lose the benefit of whatever power or powers still remain in effect on you. On the other hand, any hit point damage taken by subjects through the [Affinity Field] remains.

These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey that causes you to break hand-to-hand contact, your companions are stranded wherever you leave them. Because the planes are a dangerous place, those who lead [2Astral Caravans] usually choose to manifest this power only if they have a large party of travelers assembled. Sometimes groups of lower-level adventurers may hire you to lead forays beyond the Material Plane.$$The [Astral Caravan] power lasts while you and your fellow travelers maintain your original formation, until (1) you reach your intended destination plane, (2) you desire to end the power while still traversing the Astral Plane, (3) you or anyone traveling with you breaks the hand-to-hand chain connecting the travelers for 2 consecutive rounds, or (4) the power is terminated by some outside means, such as [Dispel Psionics].

If you are slain at some later date, your soul transfers into the storage crystal, which begins to dimly glow. Upon transference, your physical remains (should they still exist) become inert matter and cannot thereafter be restored to life. The transfer from the slain body to the [Astral Seed] works over any distance, physical or extradimensional.$$Once your body's physical demise activates the storage crystal, you have the abilities of a psicrystal of the appropriate level, plus all the powers you knew and the maximum power points you possessed when [Astral Seed] was manifested — but you also have a negative level that cannot be healed and that does not convert to real level loss in your current crystalline form. You have thirty days to grow an organic body, after which time your sentience fades and your soul passes on if it hasn't entered a new body.$$To grow a body, you (in the storage crystal) must spend ten days in uninterrupted solitude. The body's constituent parts are pulled as ectoplasm from the Astral Plane, then slowly molded and transformed into a living, breathing body that is an exact duplicate of your body at the time you manifested [Astral Seed] (the crystal itself breaks down and becomes a part of the new organic body). When the tenth day ends, you completely and totally inhabit the new body. You possess all the abilities you possessed when [Astral Seed] was manifested, at one level lower, but you have none of your equipment.

While participating in a journey allowed by the [Astral Caravan] power, you must hold the hand of both your fellow passenger ahead of you (or the caravan leader) and your fellow passenger behind you (unless you happen to be the last in the hand-linked line). If you or any one of your fellow passengers breaks the hand-to-hand link for 2 consecutive rounds, the impetus through the Astral Plane provided by [Astral Caravan] fails. See the [Astral Caravan] power for more information.$$All those who are part of the caravan who are capable of performing purely mental actions, such as manifesting a power, may do so while maintaining hand-to-hand contact with their fellow travelers. When [Astral Travelers] begin their journey, each one is connected to the Material Plane by an insubstantial silvery cord. A githyanki silver sword (see page 167) is the only known weapon that can damage a silvery cord.$$The last creature in the line of those making up the caravan is sometimes referred to as the rear guard, because he or she has one hand free and can use it to wield a weapon without relinquishing his or her grip on the next traveler in line. The weightless, subjective environment of the Astral Plane allows the caravan to flex and bend as necessary to bring the rear guard's weapon to bear.

Normally, a creature at risk of catching on fire can avoid this fate by making a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, with success indicating that the fire has gone out. If the fire is one that has been kept burning by the use of [Control Flames], then the DC of the Reflex save needed to put out the flames increases to 25.$$This power also enables you to make a fire move as if it were a living creature. You can animate only a naturally burning fire; if you attempt to animate one that has been increased or decreased in size by your augmentation of this power, the fire immediately returns to its original size. An animated fire moves at a speed of 30 feet. A fire that moves away from its fuel or its original location dies as soon as your control over it lapses.$$An animated fire can enter any square, even if a creature already occupies it. If an animated fire enters a square occupied by a creature, that creature can make a Reflex save to get out of the way (DC 11 + the number of dice of damage the fire does + your Intelligence modifier if you are a psion or your Charisma modifier if you are a wilder). A successful Reflex save moves the creature to the nearest unoccupied square.$$The flames deal the indicated damage to any creature that is either on fire or surrounded by the flames (in the fire's space); see the accompanying table).$$At the start of your turn, the animated fire deals damage to any creature in its space, and the creature catches on fire unless it makes a Reflex save (DC as noted above). A victim on fire takes 1d6 points of damage each round.$$Additional rounds in the same space as the animated fire occupies mean additional chances of ignition. The damage from multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a saving throw each round to negate each fire. It is possible to switch control from the animated fire (causing it to disappear) to intensify flames that are already burning (thus denying the foe Reflex saves after the first).$${{Augment:}} You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.*For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can increase the size of a fire you want to control by one step, up to the maximum size of fire you can control according to your manifester level.*For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can decrease the size of a fire you want to control by one step.

If you decrease the light by 50% or more, the visual ability of creatures that depend on light to see declines accordingly. For instance, a human carrying a torch can see well out to 20 feet. If you use [Control Light] to decrease the illumination around him by 75%, then the area he sees as brightly lit by the torch extends only out to 5 feet.^If you decrease the ambient light in an area by 100%, even those with [Low-Light Vision] are unable to see within the affected area.^For each 25% decrease in ambient light, characters in the area gain a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus on [Hide] checks (to a maximum of +4 when all the light is gone).*{{Increase.}} You can increase the illumination of an area by as little as 5% (barely perceptible) or as much as 100%.

For instance, you could replace the sound of a dragon's snoring with the sound of a trickling waterfall. You could change the words of a speaker into inarticulate babbling or into other words entirely (though a speaker generally comes to a halt quickly when he realizes that every word coming out of his mouth is unintended).

A creature that takes damage is also instantly freed of the compulsion (although the damage still counts against its actual current hit points).$${{Augment:}} For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's range increases by 5 feet and its save DC increases by 1.$$In addition, for every additional power point you spend to increase the range and the save DC, this power can affect targets that have HD equal to 4 + the number of additional points.

A dispelled power ends as if its duration had expired. Some powers, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by [Dispel Psionics], or can be ended only if you manifest [Dispel Psionics] at a high enough manifester level. [Dispel Psionics] can end spell-like effects just as it does powers.$$The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the psionic effect is already over before [Dispel Psionics] can take effect. You choose to use [Dispel Psionics] in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or an area dispel.*{{Targeted Dispel.}} One object, creature, or power is the target of the [Dispel Psionics] power. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum +10) against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the power's manifester level. If you succeed on a particular check, that power is dispelled; if you fail, that power remains in effect.^If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power or is under the effect of an ongoing power (such as an [Astral Construct] created by the [Astral Construct] power, or a character who has temporary hit points provided by the [2Vigor] power), you make a dispel check to end the power or its effect.^If the object that you target is a psionic item, you make a dispel check against the item's manifester level. If you succeed, all the item's psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A psionic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal power such as this.^You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that you manifested yourself.*{{Area Dispel.}} When [Dispel Psionics] is used in this way, the power affects everything within a 20-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more powers, you make a dispel check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker powers until you dispel one power (which discharges the [Dispel Psionics] power so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's psionic items are not affected.^For each object within the area that is the target of one or more powers, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Psionic items are not affected by an area dispel. For each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within the area of the [Dispel Psionics] power, you can make a dispel check to dispel the power. For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the [Dispel Psionics] power, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.^If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the power that created that object or construct in addition to attempting to dispel powers targeting the creature or object.^You can choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any power that you have manifested.$${{Augment:}} For every additional power point you spend, the bonus on your dispel check increases by 2 (to a maximum bonus of +20 for a 5-point expenditure).

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and can make a Strength check (using your increased Strength score) to burst any enclosures in the process. If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you — you cannot crush yourself to death by increasing your size.$$All your equipment, worn or carried, is similarly expanded by this power. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage (see Table 2–2, page 28 of the {Dungeon Master's Guide}). Other psionic or magical properties are not affected by this power. Any affected item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size.

When manifesting [Extend Range], you can double the range increment of a weapon you hold. If used on a thrown weapon, the weapon itself is affected by the power. If used on a ranged weapon that uses ammunition, the ammunition is not affected, but the weapon (such as a crossbow) is energized by your psionic impulse.$${{Augment:}} For every 4 additional power points you spend, you can increase the base range increment of the weapon by another 100 percent.

The weapon no longer threatens all the squares that it previously threatened, but instead threatens those that are 5 feet farther away. For example, if you manifest [Extend Reach] while using a bastard sword, you cannot attack an adjacent opponent, but you can attack one 10 feet away. If you are using a guisarme (a polearm with a 10-foot reach), you do not threaten an opponent 10 feet away, but you do threaten an opponent 15 feet away.$${{Augment:}} For every additional power point you spend, the duration increases by 1 round.

It does, however, allow you to learn the tome's contents in broad strokes. If a specific piece of information could bring forth horrific mental images, the [Eye of Isolation] blocks complete understanding so that you grasp only a general summary of that topic.$$Avoiding baneful effects in this manner still bequeaths 1d4 periods of nightmares to good- and neutral-aligned manifesters. (At the DM's discretion, you may even visit the Shallows.) For instance, when the good-aligned psion Khara manifests this power, then attempts to page through the Book of the Shallows (using inert metal rods to turn the pages), she does not fall prey to the baneful effects normally visited upon curious good-aligned readers; however, neither does she fully understand or grasp the contents therein, and so she gains no benefit. The broad summaries of the various fetid topics give her nightmares for the next 1d4 nights.$$Good manifesters first tempted by Evil usually begin innocently by gaining access to this power in a power stone.

Your duplicate thinks and acts exactly as you do and follows your orders, although it will not do anything you wouldn't do yourself. Your duplicate has all your abilities but none of your psionic or magical equipment (it does possess a duplicate of all your mundane equipment, clothing, armor, and implements, as well as mundane versions of any psionic or magical equipment you have). You and your duplicate evenly split your power points, your remaining usages of pertinent special abilities for the day, and so on. You retain your psionic focus, if you maintain such when this power is manifested. Treat your duplicate as yourself with two negative levels for the purpose of determining the powers to which the duplicate has access (while the duration of this power lasts, those negative levels cannot be removed by any means). Your duplicate has all other physical traits you had at the time you manifest this power. Powers, spells, or other effects affecting you when you manifest this power do not transfer to your duplicate.$$When the duration expires or when you dismiss the power, you and your duplicate rejoin, no matter how far from each other you are. You gain back any power points the duplicate has not spent. At the time of rejoining, you take half of the damage your duplicate has taken since this power was manifested. This damage could potentially leave you with negative hit points, but it can't reduce your hit points to less than –9.$$If your duplicate dies before the duration expires, no rejoining occurs, and you gain one negative level. If you die, your duplicate remains in existence, and is for all intents you, but with two negative levels. (Once the duration expires, one of the negative levels immediately converts to one lost level; the other negative level can be removed by standard means.)$$You can have only one fissioned duplicate in existence at one time; your duplicate cannot use this power. You cannot use [Fusion] or [Metaconcert] with a duplicate, or share any other power or effect that pools abilities (the sum of you and you is still just you). Similarly, attempting to use powers such as [Claws of the Vampire] or [Vampiric Blade] to hurt your duplicate only damages your duplicate; these powers do not heal you. [Empathic Transfer] and similar powers are likewise ineffective (transferring wounds to yourself isn't a good healing strategy).$$All powers affecting a fissioned creature, either the original or the duplicate, end when the [Fission] ends. All damage, including hit point damage, ability damage, ability drain, and ability burn damage, is added together.

Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes.$$This power works best when manifested while you are on the Astral Plane (various powers allow access to these planes, including [Astral Caravan] and [Plane Shift]). Manifestation of this power creates a local density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the fledgling plane grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from the surrounding astral ectoplasm. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn't really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases to only 1 foot per week (approximately a 50-foot increase in radius per year). Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to it using [Astral Caravan], [Plane Shift], or some other power or permanent link that you arrange for separately.$$You determine the environment within the demiplane when you manifest [Genesis], reflecting most any desire you can visualize. You determine factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This power cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). You must add these details in some other fashion if you desire. You can't create lingering psionic effects with this power; you have to add those separately, if desired. Similarly, you can't create a demiplane out of esoteric material, such as silver or uranium; you're limited to stone and dirt. You can't manipulate the time trait on your demiplane; its time trait is as the Material Plane.$$Once your demiplane reaches 180 feet in radius, you can manifest this power again to gradually add another 180 feet of radius to it, and so on.$$Antigenesis: If [Genesis] is manifested on the Material Plane, the power takes effect and the demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets no larger than a radius of 1 foot per level. The energies of the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a dead spot like a limited cancer on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot wipes away all construction, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly level area of inert dust. Living creatures that pass the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly, but plants can find no sustenance in the dust of the dead spot, water-breathing creatures die quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the area alone.$$Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains in the dead spot, and it may be colonized naturally over the course of several years by bacteria, plants, and animals.$${{XP Cost:}} 1,000.

For instance, the grafted weapon is treated as a natural weapon for the purpose of delivering a touch attack with a power in conjunction with the weapon attack. As with any power (or spell) melee touch attack made in conjunction with a natural weapon attack, the touch attack effect is not delivered unless the natural weapon strikes normally; on a failed attack, the touch power (or spell) is wasted.$$For a psychic warrior under the effect of the [Claws of the Beast] power, grafting a weapon means that attacks with this hand deal the base damage of the weapon, instead of the claw upon which a psychic warrior normally relies.$$While your hand is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand and take a –2 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of hands. Powers that temporarily polymorph or metamorph you can ignore the grafted weapon or alter it normally, at your discretion. If the weapon takes damage, you take damage as well. If you are healed, so is your grafted weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently lose 2 points of Constitution; the ability drain persists until you can restore your natural anatomy (by means of [Regenerate] or a similar effect).$$When this power's duration expires, the grafted weapon falls to the ground and your hand returns.

Thus, if ten psionic characters each contribute 10 power points, the initial total of the pooled power points is 100. One individual is chosen as the [Metaconcert] conductor by mutual consent of the other participants (this is usually the manifester, but doesn't have to be). Until the power ends, this conductor directs the efforts of the group. Misty strands of glowing power link the brows of all the participants in a complex and shifting pattern.$$All the powers of each participant are known to the mental entity created with [Metaconcert] (which is under the conductor's command). This entity can't take any more actions than a normal individual, but it manifests all its powers more effectively. Each participant contributing to the entity provides a cumulative +1 bonus to save DCs that apply when manifesting a power or using a psi-like ability. Likewise, each individual provides a cumulative +1 bonus when the entity makes its own saving throws in response to powers or psi-like abilities. If the psionic entity takes ability damage from a psionic attack, such as [Ego Whip], the total is divided among all the members as determined by the conductor (so, if a ten-person group took 3 points of ability damage, the conductor could select three different participants to each take 1 point of damage).$$If the entity manifests a power that has an XP cost, all the participants pay an equal share (the conductor pays the remainder if the cost can't be divided evenly).$$Once linked, the participants must remain within a 20-foot-radius area, and as a group can move at a speed of 10 feet. If a participant moves outside the 20-foot-radius area occupied by the others (whether willingly or involuntarily), that individual drops out of the group, and the power point pool of the [Metaconcert] is instantly recalculated. All participants who leave before a [Metaconcert] ends or is dismissed reclaim a number of power points equal to the current power point pool divided by the number of members. If the conductor drops out, the power ends. For example, if a participant left a [Metaconcert] composed of eight individuals, he would reclaim 1/8 of the power points currently in the pool (round down).

When you manifest the power, you learn the following facts about the creature.*Its name, race, alignment, and character class.*A general estimate of its level or HD: low (5 HD or lower), medium (6 to 11 HD), high (12 to 20 HD), very high (21 HD to 40 HD), or deific (41 HD or higher).*Its location (including place of residence, town, country, world, and plane of existence).*Significant items currently in its possession.*Any significant activities or actions the creature has undertaken in the previous 8 hours, including details such as locales traveled through, the names or races of those the creature fought, spells it cast, items it acquired, and items it left behind (including the location of those items).*A current mental view of the creature, as described in the [Remote Viewing] power, which you can maintain for up to 1 minute per level.$$The DM determines what items or activities are significant to the envisioned creature. For instance, a high-level character probably pays little attention to a potion of [Cure Light Wounds] in her belt, but a low-level character might regard it as a significant possession. Similarly, no one regards a routine meal as noteworthy, but attending a court banquet most likely would be.$$[Metafaculty] can defeat spells, powers, and special abilities such as [Screen] or [Mind Blank] (or even a [Wish] spell) that normally obscure clairsentience powers.

You cannot take the form of any creature that has a template. Your type and subtype (if applicable) change to match the new form.$$Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal you further). If you are slain while under the effect of this power, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead.$$You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also gain all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as [Constrict], [Improved Grab], and [Poison]) but do not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form (such as [Blindsense], [Fast Healing], [Regeneration], and [Scent]) or any supernatural, psionic, or spell-like abilities.$$You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and special qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have, if any. You keep all extraordinary special attacks and special qualities derived from class levels, but you lose any benefits of the racial traits of your normal form. If you have a template, special abilities it provides are likewise not retained.$$If the assumed form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any manifesting ability you had in your original form.$$You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws or a bite), racial bonuses on skill checks, racial bonus feats, and any anatomical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.$$You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's species. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this power to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your [Disguise] check.$$When the change occurs, your equipment either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item in question) or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your normal form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its normal form.$$You can also use this power to assume the form of an inanimate object. You gain the object's hardness and retain your own hit points.$$You can take the shape of almost any simple object you can think of, such as a chair, a sword, or a rug. If you attempt to take the form of a complex object, you must make an appropriate skill check. For instance, if you want to take the form of a beautiful painting, you must make a [Craft] (painting) check against a DC set by the DM to determine the quality of the painting. If you fail the check, your manifestation of the power does not succeed.$$Likewise, you cannot take the form of a complex mechanical mechanism unless you have some sort of skill associated with the object. You cannot use this power to assume the form of a psionic item or a magic item, or any object with a hardness of 15 or higher. You also cannot take the form of a psionically animated mechanism or any object formed of ectoplasm.$$As an inanimate object, you lose all mobility. You retain your normal senses and your ability to speak. You can manifest a power if you make a [Concentration] check (DC 20 + power level); however, doing so ends the duration of this power. If you take damage while in the form of an object, your actual body also takes damage (but the object's hardness, if any, protects you).

The subject lives within its own made-up world until the time of its actual death.*{{Area Effect.}} If [Microcosm] is manifested on an area, it sends all affected creatures into a shared catatonia (the world is a construct, but within the world, the victims can interact with each other). It affects only creatures that currently have 30 or fewer hit points, and only up to a total of 300 hit points of such creatures. The power affects creatures with the lowest hit point totals first.

(In effect, the subject has received eight negative levels — but these are negative levels that can't be removed.) The subject does not have any of your physical ability scores or equipment, but does have the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores you had when you were eight levels lower. The subject also knows the powers you knew when you were eight levels lower.$$While the subject is initially your mental duplicate, the two personalities diverge over time. Although the subject starts off with memories of your experiences, it possesses its original "soul" and physical body and is free to develop its own personality based on its own new experiences. Thus, the subject is not your slave or servant, but instead a nonplayer character in its own right that shares your earlier memories.$$[Protection from Evil] or a similar spell or power can prevent you from implanting [Mind Seed], or prevent a seed from germinating while the protective power lasts. Otherwise, a germinating seed can be removed (prior to germination) only by [Psychic Chirurgery], [Reality Revision], or similarly high-level effects.

You can move your mind back into your own body whenever you desire, which returns the subject's mind to its own body and ends the power.$$If the manifestation succeeds, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force takes over yours.

While your dreamself is in the vault, you can access items stored there with previous manifestations of the power, if any.$$If you have the [Lucid Dreaming] feat, this power can serve you well in another way. Besides acting as a place to store valuables, the dream vault can allow you to catch up on your reading (if you have the tome you wish to read with you in the vault), or, if you have assembled all the requisite physical materials needed (through multiple manifestations of this power), you can accomplish other tasks. For instance, if you brought or stored the proper items, you could repair weaponry or make arrows (though normal skill checks apply). Your lucid dreamself can stay in the dream vault for a maximum of eight hours. Any external force that would normally awaken you also wakes you and ejects you from the dream vault. When your dreamself leaves the dream vault (and you wake up), you may take any one object with you back into the waking world. This object appears in the hands of your physical body as you wake.$$The down side of using [Lucid Dreaming] to catch up on tasks in your dream vault is that you do not gain the restful benefits of sleep, including power point recovery.$$No matter where you are located physically when you sleep, you can always access your dream vault.

Furthermore, while a psionic sword does not function psionically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The power has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned or have a limited duration, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.$$[Dispel Psionics] does not remove the field. Two or more [2Null Psionics Fields] sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain powers may be unaffected by [Null Psionics Field] (see the individual power descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal power such as this. Should a creature's space extend across the boundary of the area enclosed by the field, any part of the creature that lies outside the effect is unaffected by the field.

When your power point reserve climbs to 1 or higher, your psianimated undead return to normal, assuming they haven't been destroyed in the meantime.$$Regardless of the type of undead, you cannot use a single manifestation of [Psianimate Dead] to animate more HD of undead than twice your manifester level with a single use of this power. The undead creature you psianimate retains all its extraordinary abilities, but not its supernatural or spell-like abilities. The undead creature loses all class abilities, if any. The psianimated creature retains all its ability scores, except for its Constitution (which undead do not possess). The psianimated creature gains the undead type.$$The undead creature you psianimate remains under your control indefinitely. However, no matter how many times you use this power (or similar powers or spells), you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per manifester level. If you exceed this number, all the newly psianimated undead creatures fall under your control, but any excess undead from previous manifestations become inert (you choose which creatures become inert). Psianimated undead rendered inert in this fashion must be animated again with this power, if you desire their service once more.

Before the psyche of the deceased has completely left the body, this power halts its journey while repairing somewhat the damage to the body.$$This power functions like the [Raise Dead] spell, except that the affected creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of powers. The creature has –1 hit points (but is stable) after being restored to life.$${{XP Cost:}} 200. For every 100 additional experience points that both you and the subject pay, the manifestation of this power can be delayed by 1 additional round. For example, if you and the subject both pay an extra 500 XP, it works on a creature that has been dead for up to 6 rounds.

This ability allows you to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. With the [Scent] ability, you can identify familiar odors just as humanoids do familiar sights.$$You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.$$When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed — only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source's location.$$If you have the [Track] feat, you can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or [Survival]) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the [Track] feat. If you are tracking with [Psionic Scent], you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

The subject must abide by the standard rules for selecting skills and feats, and so it cannot take feats for which it doesn't qualify or take cross-class skills as class skills.$$For instance, a subject, upon attaining her current level, put 2 skill points into [Spot] and chose the [Dodge] feat as part of her benefits for level advancement. She has since decided that she would rather have put 2 points in [Autohypnosis] and taken the [Burrowing Power] metapsionic feat instead. After this power is manifested on her, she can reverse her earlier decisions. She could also choose to change the power or powers she learned when reaching her current level, but she is happy with her original decision, and so does not change her powers known.$${{XP Cost:}} This power costs 50 XP to reformat choices made when the character reached her current level. For each additional previous level into which the revision reaches, the power costs an additional 50 XP. The manifester and subject split all XP costs evenly.

In this latter case, treat the lost Intelligence points as ability damage.$$The scimitar appears in your hand when first manifested. Directing the scimitar takes a standard action. Once directed to attack an enemy within range, it disappears and then reappears in melee with that creature; thus, you can use a [Psychic Scimitar] to attack enemies at a distance. Attacks with a [Psychic Scimitar] are melee touch attacks. The power gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll. Attacking with a [Psychic Scimitar] counts normally as an attack. You can choose to redirect the scimitar to attack a new opponent; doing so requires an additional standard action.$$The blade deals 1d6 points of damage. Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage even if you wield the blade in your hand. If you wield the scimitar in your hand, you are treated as proficient even if you lack proficiency with the scimitar. Other creatures cannot wield your [Psychic Scimitar].$$A [Psychic Scimitar] always strikes from your direction. The blade cannot flank targets as a creature can. The blade is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has [Improved Evasion], your save bonuses, and a base AC of 22. Your Intelligence modifier applies to the blade's AC as if it were the scimitar's Dexterity modifier. A [Psychic Scimitar] has 4 hit points.$$You can also use your scimitar to deliver the effect of any power of 4th level or lower with a range of touch that you can manifest. If you make a successful attack with the blade, the power is manifested on the target as if you had manifested it yourself.$$After it delivers a power, or if the blade goes beyond range or moves out of your sight, the blade returns to you and hovers until given further direction.$${{Augment:}} For every 2 additional power points you spend, the [Psychic Scimitar] deals 1 additional point of damage.

The drained points simply dissipate. Your touch attack, charged with psionic power, is treated as an armed attack.$$If you manifest this power to affect a natural weapon you possess, you must make a successful melee attack with the weapon to gain the power's benefit.$$Against a psionic being that has no power points (such as a psionic character with an empty power point reserve) or a nonpsionic foe, your attack instead deals 2 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (your choice).

This is a mind-affecting effect. You must have one hand free to use a [Psychic Whip], but can use it in your off hand while wielding a weapon in your primary hand.$$You can make trip attacks with a [Psychic Whip] as with a normal whip, but your opponent gets no automatic chance to trip you if your attack fails. A [Psychic Whip] also grants you a normal whip's +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls to disarm an opponent, but the opponent gets no automatic attempt to disarm you if your attack fails. You can use a [Psychic Whip] in this manner even if you are not proficient with the whip.$${{Augment:}} |You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.|*If you spend 2 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a swift action instead of a standard action.*If you spend 4 additional power points, you can use a [Psychic Whip] to make a single area attack at any time during the power's duration. As a full-round action, you sweep the whip around you, dealing 1d6 points of damage to every creature in the area (Reflex half). Creatures that fail their Reflex saves must then make a successful Will save or be knocked prone and stunned for 1 round. This use of the [Psychic Whip] immediately ends the power.

When you do this, there is a 75% chance that the [Quintessence] evaporates back into the continuum.

However, psionic characters and creatures are generally loath to do so because accumulations of [Quintessence] weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity within a 5-foot radius of the accumulation: Powers require twice as many power points to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful Will save (DC 16) each time he or she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these circumstances, manifesting a psi-like ability that is usable at will is a full-round action rather than a standard action.

[Reality Revision] cannot prevent a character who is brought back to life from losing a level.*Transport travelers. This power can lift one creature per manifester level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.*Undo misfortune. [Reality Revision] can undo a single recent event. Manifesting the power forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.$$You can try to use [Reality Revision] to produce more powerful effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a manifestation gives the DM the opportunity to respond to your request without fulfilling it completely. (The manifestation may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)$$Duplicated powers allow saves and power resistance as normal (but save DCs are calculated as though the power is 9th level).$${{XP Cost:}} The minimum XP cost for manifesting [Reality Revision] is 5,000. When a manifestation duplicates a power that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a manifestation creates or improves a psionic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.

The buffer cannot push through walls or other barriers. The radius at which the buffer surrounds you remains constant for the duration, which means you will be slowed to half your normal speed if you move down a narrow corridor too small to contain the field easily.$$Any creature of Large or smaller size that tries to move through the field is slowed to half its normal speed.

Each round, as a standard action, you can choose one creature within the field to be subject to a bull rush with a Strength check result of 30. If the creature succeeds on its opposed check, it remains where it is, but since it is still within the field, it cannot move closer without straining (see above).

The ectoforms seem to fission seamlessly from your own form or from an earlier generated ectoform, and they initially appear in any clear space you designate that is adjacent to you or adjacent to one of your earlier ectoforms (if the earlier ectoform is adjacent to you). "Throwing" occurs automatically at the beginning of each round and requires no action on your part. The power is suppressed if you are in a space with no physical room to allow you to spawn additional ectoforms or if you have a number of ectoforms equal to your manifester level already in existence from previous rounds of using this power. The power begins to function again when space permits or when one or more of your previously thrown ectoforms is destroyed. When the duration elapses, all surviving ectoforms dissipate. (Nothing can prevent this, although the Astral Zealot prestige class abilities may extend the duration as noted in Chapter Eight.) If you manifest this power a second time while the first is still active, the first power lapses and the second takes its place.$$Ectoforms possess a thin semblance of your personality, but none of your powers or abilities (treat them as constructs); if interacted with outside of melee, they are instantly recognizable as shams. Your ectoforms pop like balloons, dissipating, if they are successfully attacked or targeted by any melee, ranged, power, or spell attack, or if they otherwise take damage, no matter how slight. An ectoform's AC is 10 + size modifier + your Dexterity modifier. An ectoform is weak, and it can directly accomplish anything you could accomplish with the [Far Hand] power, but no more. It can speak, sounding like you, but its memories are vague and shadowy — obviously fabricated and incomplete.$$An ectoform is partially independent, though it acts on your wishes when first thrown, since it is a reflection of you. Thereafter you cannot mentally command it or verbally direct it. For instance, you may have intended for the ectoform formed in the first round to run west for 500 feet then report back, while the ectoforms of the next round can be directed to run interference between you and a foe. You do not gain any special means of communication with your ectoform.$$As a special function of the power, you can instantaneously and secretly exchange places with an ectoform as it is thrown into an adjacent space so that you can further confuse enemies. (You can do this only as you throw an ectoform, not with a previously thrown one.) Enemies attempting to attack you or manifest powers at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. On each round you generate an ectoform that you change places with (and remain adjacent to for that round), attackers must succeed at a Will saving throw to determine which figure is really you. They gain a cumulative –2 circumstance penalty on their Will save for each ectoform adjacent to you beyond the first. [True Seeing] and [Psionic True Seeing], of course, reveal the real you.$${{Note:}} This power is psychophilosophically incompatible with the arcane spell [Mirror Image]; if both are attempted, the one manifested (or cast) first is the effect that occurs; the other effect is nullified.$${{XP Cost:}} 1.

You permanently exchange bodies with the subject. Since this power's duration is instantaneous, you cannot be forced to return to your natural body by means of [Dispel Psionics], an [Antimagic Field], or a similar effect.$$If the subject's body dies while you are in it, you are dead. The subject immediately loses one level, but otherwise survives the experience in your natural body. If your natural body dies while the subject is in it, you immediately lose one level, but you likewise survive the experience in your new body.$$Your "natural" body is always considered to be the last one you switched out of. If you exchange bodies with a chain of multiple subjects, you need worry only about the welfare of the last body you switched with. In other words, if your mind is expelled from your current body, your mind returns to the last body you switched with, not to your original body. Similarly, if your original body dies but you have since switched minds with a second subject, you take no penalty. You lose a level only if the body you inhabited immediately prior to your current body is killed.$${{XP Cost:}} 10,000.
